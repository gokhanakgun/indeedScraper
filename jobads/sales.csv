0|Inside Sales Representative and Enterprise Account Manager|"Our SaaS company is looking to expand our all-remote (work from home) inside sales team for our cloud storage, sync, and automation service, Files.com.

Files.com caters to a variety of small, medium, and enterprise businesses by providing compatibility with new and legacy automated systems without sacrificing a modern user experience.

You will be selling per-user packages with an ACV (annual contract value) of $300-30k+. Our marketing team invests heavily in paid online advertising and lead generation from events to deliver you a steady stream of highly qualified leads who already want the service we offer.

You will also be selling to channel partners, letting you create ongoing commissions based on the growth of your territory.

Files.com is easily demonstrated visually via screen sharing, offers a ton of value at its price point, and has 3 separate plan offerings to increase your commissions via upsells.

Additionally, you will also take on an Account Manager role for some of our existing customers, and have the opportunity to earn commissions from upselling existing customers.

About Files.com

Files.com is the new name for BrickFTP, a cloud storage service that has existed since 2009 and has over 1,700 paying business customers.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

Our products and services are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing

Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people. So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most motivated people, and create an environment in which they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company

You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer vacations and have fun.

Every quarter, you’ll travel to an in-person meeting with the entire team to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a remote team.

For our Inside Sales Executives and Account Managers, we look for the following:
Have at least 5 years of directly applicable experience.
History of selling software, cloud, or other telecommunications services to businesses.
Experience giving one-on-one sales presentations via remote video/screen sharing.
Able to participate in trade shows and in-person selling opportunities.
Knowing the line between healthy follow-up and being overly obnoxious, and then walking that line with every lead.
Professional phone demeanor and ability to communicate effectively via the phone.
Perfect grammar, professional tone, and friendly conversation flow via email and live chat.
Understanding of the technical aspects of hosting and cloud storage.
Interest in taking on additional roles within the Company and a commitment to growing your capabilities.

Engineering and coding experience is a major plus because some prospects are developers or IT people themselves.

Our Core Beliefs

Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:
We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire. We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.

We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work. Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Files.com. Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Files.com great.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits

Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.

At Files.com, we look for results, so our initial screening roundstarts by reviewing your previous results as a sales executive or account manager.

As part of your application, write a cover letter which should include the following:

Describe your typical strategy for understanding a new business and turning a lead into a sale.

We collaborate closely with internal and external partners to craft plans and programs that scale the business and adoption of the Apple ecosystem.
Key Qualifications
No matter the audience, you are very good at presenting. And, you’re cool under pressure. You make the complex simple and you command an audience by bringing them along for the journey. You support others to learn, to be curious and ultimately, share your passion for the Apple story. When challenged with complex questions, you share your deep knowledge of how our hardware, software and services integrate.
Apple doesn’t cut corners, in products or in business. You bring the highest level of integrity, honesty, and accountability in all that you do, every single day. You are a trusted advisor who does what you say you’ll do – and always does what’s best for Apple.
You see the world through the eyes of the customer by deeply understanding their business needs, challenges, and concerns. At Apple, we obsess over how people experience our products and services. You not only meet our customers’ expectations, but you exceed them.
Customer and partner needs can often be unique – but, you’re quick on your feet and connect and influence the right people both inside and outside of Apple. As a go to person with leadership, you are trusted and comfortable in tough situations. You can settle disputes, negotiations and be responsible for the hard calls with minimal noise. You step up to conflicts and see them as opportunities to shine.
You believe that communication is key to Apple’s success. You’re a dreamer and someone who actively talks and listens through endless possibilities – with customers and teammates alike. To ensure the most innovative ideas become a reality, you recognize perspectives, patiently listen to every detail and commit to what is right, in order to move us forward.
You know yourself – you have strengths, weaknesses and opportunities - but you also know the people around you and are open to their feedback. You relate well to all kinds of people – up, down, and sideways, inside and outside the organization. When faced with a challenging opportunity, you know who to connect with and when. People know you as a true collaborator who knows what it takes to win.
Apple and third party solutions tackle complex business problems in simple and innovative ways. You create compelling and breakthrough strategies that truly shape the future. You do this by asking why and why not, both stripping out what is not essential and identifying what is. By doing so, you are able to see what’s ahead and identify trends that will be critical for growth.
Strive for excellence in everything you do. Due to changing priorities, urgent customer needs, or a final push to meet a quarterly forecast, you face the daily challenge of where to focus your time and energy. You'll demonstrate a don’t give up attitude, and finish, when you experience resistance or setbacks. You seize every opportunity and help to empower others to reach their goals along the way.
You adapt to change and find the right path without necessarily having all of the pieces to the puzzle. At Apple, things aren’t always clear but you shift gears and thrive when asked to explore new ground, rather than waiting on others.
Description
We develop account plans that align Apple and the partner’s growth strategies to expand adoption of the Apple ecosystem in the Enterprise and B2B segments. We effectively execute on plans by cross-functionally collaborating with Sales Operations, Finance, Inside Sales, Systems Engineers, the Reseller teams and Strategic Partners.
