While we are food-obsessed, we are also customer-obsessed. We look to constantly innovate our technology so our diners’ food experience is memorable, restaurant owners get more business and individuals across the country looking for work can deliver the food from the restaurant to the diner flawlessly.

We’re a group of talented, highly-motivated individuals with a shared passion for clean, well-tested, highly maintainable software. We’re looking to expand our team to support the rapid growth we’re expecting to begin in the next couple months.
Some Challenges Youâll Tackle:
What tools and strategies help us stay at the cutting edge of the native mobile ecosystem?
Our SDK is currently the foundation for over 200 apps. How can we safely expand to double that? Quadruple?
We’re constantly developing awesome new features. Just a few topics we’re looking at for early 2020: a highly configurable homescreen; unified systems of design patterns; enhanced delivery capabilities leverage the powerful Grubhub ecosystem; and collaborating on the popular Grubhub app.
You Should Have:
1-2 years of professional native iOS development experience in Swift or Objective C
Excellent written and spoken English communication skills
Computer science degree, similar technical education, or equivalent practical experience
Distributed version control experience with Git

109|Android Developer|"About Hive:

Hive is a full stack deep learning platform helping to bring companies into the AI era.

Two Stanford graduate students determined to build practical applications using novel deep learning technologies founded Hive (https://thehive.ai/). From the beginning, we knew that high-quality datasets were critical to creating deep learning models. However, we also knew that the quantity of labeled data also has a huge impact on model performance. With this in mind, we first started by building a data- labelling platform specifically designed to solve machine-learning problems. This platform, Hive Data, is now the world’s largest distributed human workforce for data labelling and produces millions of high-quality annotations every day. Hive Data allows us to label uncommonly large datasets at a fraction of the cost that other data labelling solutions would charge. Once Hive Data was built, we were able to quickly label enormous datasets and rapidly build a suite of machine learning models that now form our core offerings in Hive Predict.
Our Hive Predict team has since built a wide range of custom machine learning models spanning a range of verticals including media, retail, security, and autonomous driving. Drawing on this experience and expertise, we then set out to build a stand-alone analytics platform for TV advertising called Hive Media. Hive Media synthesises our company's fundamental technologies and leverages industry partnerships to deliver a truly revolutionary product. Hive offers the only true, full- stack deep learning platform in the world, assisting clients with data labelling, model building, and the development of full enterprise solutions.
Today, we work with some of the largest companies in the world to redefine how they think about unstructured visual data and together we build solutions that completely transform verticals. We are fortunate to be funded by leading investors like Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), General Catalyst, Formation 8, and others. We have over 160 talented individuals globally, based in our San Francisco and Gurugram offices.

In order to execute our vision, we need to grow our team of best-in-class engineers. We are looking for talented Android developers who will thrive in an autonomous engineering-driven environment. You will take ownership of a product and have the ability to shape product direction.
Responsibilities:
Design and develop a delightful Android application for our users, with a focus on simplicity of use and high-performance
Write product-independent code and design modular APIs to be used across all of our products
Work across disciplines with team members from front-end, backend, design, and product
Help ensure we’re bug-free by writing unit-tests, and regularly communicating with our QA team
Actively participate in product decisions, ensuring we set reasonable development deadlines

You attended a top university, studying computer science or similar

Welcome!

We're so happy you found us. Since you've come this far, it's safe to say you're curious about our story and what career opportunities exist, so we'd love to start by introducing ourselves.

About us

Twenty20 is bringing stock photography into the modern, mobile age. Our global community of over 250,000 creative mobile photographers have contributed over 45 million photos for sale, making us the largest crowdsourced commercial image catalog in the world. We sell those images to companies like Google, Uber, Thought Catalog, and other leading brands/startups/agencies who are looking for a more authentic alternative to traditional stock imagery.

We are a small, autonomous, 7-person team based in Los Angeles, Marina del Rey working as part of the Envato family.

At Twenty20, we're working hard to build a marketplace that connects amateur and professional photographers to brands and agencies that want to buy photos of real people, having real emotions, doing real things. We have tons of massive challenges in engineering and product over both a short timeline as well as over a longer time horizon. We work with massive amounts of unstructured data, and we're constantly learning and building new ways to help our customers tell their stories with images from our photographer community.

Every team member touches every part of our code base, and we care deeply about fostering an environment that allows us all to teach and learn from each other, regardless of your role or area of expertise. Our engineers work closely with product owners and designers to understand our unique community of artists and buyers, and use that understanding to build highly scalable systems, software, and tools to make them happy and productive.

What you'll be doing

We work to solve hard problems around photo classification, community management and data analysis, just to name some of the domains we deal with on a daily basis. Lucky for us, we have an amazing team, now we're looking to add to our crew, -- if you think you might fit in, we'd love to hear from you!

As our iOS Mobile Engineer, you'll be working on an app used by hundreds of thousands of photographers to participate in our social marketplace of authentic content. You will be part of the team that helps photographers make a living doing the things they love. There's a little bit of everything to play with, social interactions, commercial interactions, gamification, and machine learning. You won't be bored!

On a day to day basis you will:
Write clean, well thought out and reliable code
Participate as a member of a small cross functional team containing members with different skills and experience
You'll work on big projects, small maintenance tasks, and anything else that makes software our customers love
Take lots of responsibility for your work as most teams don't have analysts, testers or system administrators
Take part in our 24/7 on-call rotation supporting one of the biggest websites in the world
Our Stack:

193|Android Developer|"If you or a loved one has ever experienced a major medical event, you know how overwhelming it is to process the flood of information that follows—whether it’s hastily delivered guidance from your doctor, or a pile of paperwork on managing your recovery. And once you get home, it can feel impossible to know where to start, or how to stay on track to reach your health goals.

At Wellframe, we’re helping healthcare organizations fill this gap, so people can get the holistic resources and support they need to feel their best, outside traditional care delivery settings. Through our patented platform, Wellframe translates evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines and literature into an interactive daily checklist delivered to patients through the Wellframe mobile app. As patients engage with the Wellframe app, their data is shared in real time with their care team through the care team dashboard, which utilizes advanced algorithms to generate early intervention alerts. With secure two-way messaging, Wellframe facilitates long-term, trusted relationships between patients and care teams.

We are looking for a talented and highly motivated Android Developer to come and join our Mobile team, to help us reach new levels of health management. We love to share knowledge here and are looking for someone who enjoys mentoring people and who wants to continue to learn on a daily basis.

You will be developing and delivering our next generation healthcare user experience by combining the latest mobile technology with clinical medicine and machine learning.

The projects you'll be working on involve accessibility, medical device integration, data visualization and integrations with cloud services.
Who you are:
You have at least a Bachelor's degree. Yes, in any field, but a field associated with computer programming, such as computer science or other engineering, would be a plus.
You are an advanced user of at least one modern operating system and can create applications for it. Developing for Android is a distinct plus.
You are ready and willing to learn something new. You are especially motivated to learn Android deeply. And, with your fundamental knowledge, you can learn whatever new technology or OS we may need to support in the future.
You are an experienced software engineer for at least six continuous years, with a significant part of your work on mobile platforms. We generally expect that your experience is more than that, but the minimal requirement is concerned with your ability to leverage your development skills successfully. Note “in a team”, you need to demonstrate your capacity for successful teamwork.
You are familiar with concepts such as networks, databases, servers, communications and information security, and you have successfully participated in software development involving at least some of that.
The modern software development cycle and tooling is just something you know, and if you have not worked with a particular platform, IDE, compiler, source control or bug tracking system, you should be able to get going with minimal hand holding.
You are aware that software is built not only with code, processes and tools, but also through leadership, collaboration, and strategic thinking. We’ll help you become a highly successful, well-rounded software engineer.

We are a Series A, audio-tech start-up co-founded by Mike Einziger, lead guitarist of Incubus, and run by serial entrepreneur and veteran product executive, John Vars. We build wireless solutions for real-time data delivery at live events. Starting first in the music industry, we have built a platform to allow concert-goers to stream the same in-ear audio feed that musicians get on stage – direct from the mixing board (as opposed to blasted over huge speakers into the open air). We have so far partnered with incredible acts like Metallica, Aerosmith, Pharell, and Charlie Puth, among others. We are now also turning our attention to live sports (play-by-play commentary, anyone?), conferences, and anywhere else where improved audio can make for a better experience!
This is an exciting time for Mixhalo! We closed $10.7 million in Series A funding and moved into a brand new office space. We are now growing our team and expanding our product offering. Want to be part of the journey?
How you'll be contributing:
We want to make our current Android app and audio engine more feature-rich, stable and flexible. As we continue to grow the MIXhalo platform outside of live events, we will use the app as a home base for content, whether for professional musicians or amateurs who are just trying to share their passion. You will:
Contribute early in product planning, giving feedback on specs and roadmap planning
Implement user interfaces based on designs and specs
Implement and fine-tune our one-of-a-kind, low latency audio engine in Android.
Build out robust communication with both our cloud and on-premise backend infrastructure
Thoughtfully balance moving quickly with long-term sustainability, and consider areas we should refactor, and propose architecture improvements.
Provide solutions to complex, vendor specific hardware problems relating to disparate network stack implementations on Android hardware platforms
Develop JNIs to interface with our proprietary C audio library
Focus on portability and scalability – we build software that works well and consistently on multiple platforms.
Learn about new concepts and technologies from your coworkers, and contribute your own ideas and knowledge
Help fix those out-of-tune bugs
Bring performance consistency to multiple Android hardware platforms
Ideal Candidate:
BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience
Have 2+ years professional experience programming and shipping production code
Knowledge of and experience with Java, Android Studio, Kotlin, Gradle, among others
Love for building products and features from the ground up, but the experience to master and maintain an existing code base.
Willing to learn and work with low level languages such as C / C++
Highly collaborative – you'll support and/or lead a team of engineers and also work with our business team to constantly develop products that meet users' needs.
Experience writing JNI's and interfacing with other languages within Android code.
Experience circumventing issues arising from Android device fragmentation.
A proven track record of implementing compatibility across Android versions
A passion for music and other live events
What it's like working at Mixhalo:

Every day at Mixhalo is unlike the one before. You will work with very talented people in an intense, fast-paced environment. As a team, we can go from 0-100 very quickly as we continue to deploy our product while simultaneously working to get MIXhalo the exposure it deserves. If you are looking for a stretch position, with open-minded colleagues who embrace the growth mindset and get super excited about music and all sorts of other live experiences, this is probably the place for you!
