About Sitetracker
Sitetracker was founded seven years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the #2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people-first culture."

Running performance analytics on the digital products to determine what’s working and where we need to improve – and then reporting on those analytics to all levels of the org

What does the Digital Product Manager need to have in order to succeed in this role?
A few things, but mainly:

We have fun.

No, really. We do. We care about what we do and we expect the work to get done on time, but we know there are extremely, vitally important things about your life outside of work, and we want you to take those things just as seriously.
We are passionately interested in trying the new and untested.
Have a new idea? Perfect! That’s exactly what we want to hear about, and exactly what we want to try out.

171|Product Manager|"A Product Manager at Klaviyo is passionate about identifying, spec’ing and shipping solutions to solve customer problems.

Our customers are businesses that want to grow. They know there is power in using their data to communicate with their customers in more relevant and targeted ways, but the existing platforms in the market have always been too hard to use or too expensive to take advantage of. Klaviyo customers are passionate, hard-working, ambitious and have incredibly high standards. They expect to deliver the best experiences for their customers and expect us to deliver the best experiences for them, too. We are looking to add people to our team who can help build a world-class product that will continue to delight our customers and exceed their expectations of what’s possible.

Your First 90 Days

In your first 30 days, you will get acclimated to Klaviyo and our product:
Take a course on our product and ace the test at the end
Spend 80% of your time working with support
Answer >20 support tickets
Talk to >10 customers on the phone and/or in person
Connect with every internal team and learn what will help them succeed
Learn the basic architectural overview of the product

In your first 60 days, you will become a valuable member of the product and engineering organization:
Spend 60% of your time with support
Become a go-to expert on how the product should behave
Take ownership of 1 key area that you will improve
Complete a product enhancement from spec to successful completion during a sprint

In your first 90 days, you will push the ball forward:
Spend 30% of your time with support
Become the owner of a functional area of the product
Plan out a key product improvement (identify problem, define key metrics, brainstorm ideas, test hypotheses, write spec)

Team Openings

We’re always looking for all types of dynamic and analytical Product Managers, but here are the specific teams we’re looking to hire for now:

Marketing Automation
Site Reliability & Platform
Profiles / CRM
Data Science (x3)
How you will make a difference:
Spec - PMs at Klaviyo go deep. They love to define every use case a customer would consider, document potential ways to solve, identify outstanding concerns, flag edge cases, and leave no stone unturned. They sweat the details and are passionate about making sure that every experience that could come from a feature is understood, anticipated, and handled elegantly.
Work with Customers - PMs at Klaviyo spend at least 15% of their time working closely with customers. We do deep dives with customers to work on actual marketing strategy and implementation; this helps us intimately understand what our customers are trying to accomplish and what stands in their way. You should feel excited about the chance to not only meet customers, but to spend time doing their job for them to truly experience their world.
Set and Manage Roadmap - PMs at Klaviyo understand the business and prioritize the most valuable efforts. Each PM takes ownership of a product area with their cross-functional team, and is responsible for helping set the priority order of what the team delivers on to advance our mission and maintain product quality. They communicate their roadmaps proactively, including when things change and why.
Write and Share - PMs at Klaviyo write and share early and often. We write ideas. We write use cases. We write requirements. We write release plans. Someone who joins Klaviyo must love to write and must be exceptional at articulating their thinking through written word. You should enjoy expressing your thinking on paper and reviewing your ideas with people around the company each week.
Wireframe - PMs at Klaviyo love to draw. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a wireframe is worth a million. PMs are quick to get on a whiteboard and explain their thinking, and even faster to document that thinking into expected use cases, behaviors and edge cases (see “Spec” above). You should love drawing pictures, getting feedback, and iterating on them.
Learn - PMs at Klaviyo are voracious learners. We are constantly passing book or article recommendations to each other, sharing interesting insights, and digging into unknown problems. A lack of experience/knowledge around a challenge is exciting because it means once we solve it, we are guaranteed to learn something new. You should love learning and tackling new challenges.
Think Critically - PMs at Klaviyo are sharp. We think deeply, quickly, and analytically. The rigor of thought is extreme here so we can ensure we’re making the best decision possible at all times. You should love to tease out problems, break them down to small, digestible pieces, and put them back together elegantly.
Ship - PMs at Klaviyo get value into customer hands. At the end of the day, we are only as good as how our customers see us; we must deliver improved solutions and experiences every single day. PMs build close relationships with their cross-functional teams to efficiently spec, build, and release high quality product at a fast cadence. You should be energized by solving tough problems, but nothing should compare to the feeling of releasing value to customers and watching your success metrics move.
Who You Are:
Not looking for a standard 9-5.
Want to learn and master new things.
Passionate about Product Management as a career.
Love wire-framing and sharing your ideas.
Hands on and not just ""part of determining strategy"".
Have opinions about products and features you love or really don’t love.
Get excited about having big ideas, and even more excited about executing on them.
Get to know Klaviyo

Manage the daily workflow of a team of engineers and designers. Do whatever your team needs to help them keep moving.

Understand our users: Identify user needs and spot opportunities to build personalized experiences that improve engagement and retention, grow the user base and delight our (current and potential) users.

About Wealthfront

Wealthfront is a nextgen banking service. We help you manage your money for both your short-term and long-term goals by providing a cash account with a top-of-market APY, best-in-class automated investment management, and free financial advice, anytime you want it. We entered into the banking space in a big way this past year with the launch of our cash account that offers an interest rate 18x greater than the national average. We’ve been overwhelmed by the response and grew over 100% last year to manage over $23 billion in total client assets.

Our ultimate vision is to optimize and automate all of our clients’ finances and build what we call Self-Driving Money™️. We want clients to be able to automatically deposit their paycheck into their Wealthfront account, and let us take care of the rest — paying their bills, topping off their emergency fund or 401(k), and investing the rest based on their specific goals and lifestyle. To get there, we’ll be focusing the bulk of our 2020 efforts on creating a better alternative to what the banking industry provides. Join us so you can help us turn this industry on its head and build a service that our clients don't just like, they love."

Project Management - Presenting project status reports and facilitating product demos for our team and clients.

503|Senior Product Manager, QuickBooks Cash|"People who work for themselves fuel our global economy. In the US, small businesses employ 60% of the workforce and create 80% of new jobs; internationally the stats are even more skewed. But the odds are stacked against them: one of two will fail in the first five years and two of three before they can turn ten.

Cash flow is one of the most significant challenges facing a small business’ survival. In fact, 61% of small business owners have regular issues related to cash flow, often stemming from late customer payments, cumbersome tracking of cash inflows and outflows across multiple spreadsheets and bank accounts, and slow payment processing by incumbent institutions. These challenges result in slower business growth and incredible stress on the owner-operator.

Intuit’s Small Business and Self-Employed Group (SBSEG) is committed to creating tools and services that dramatically increase an SMB’s ability to manage their cash flow. QuickBooks Cash is at the center of that strategy and serves as the connective tissue between QuickBooks Payments, Capital, Payroll, and other money-in and money-out services in the QuickBooks ecosystem."

About Faire

Are you ready to change an industry? Excited to enter on the ground floor of a fast-paced, high-growth startup in a wide open market?

There are over 1M independent retailers in the US and Canada, doing more than twice the revenue of Walmart and Amazon combined. Economic data shows: compared to the big box stores, local retailers are flourishing because they offer a better shopping experience. However, the antiquated wholesale industry is holding independent stores back, and making life miserable for the makers trying to reach them.

Our goal at Faire is to rethink the wholesale model with an online marketplace that makes it easy for retailers and makers to connect and succeed together. Instead of flying all over the country to attend trade shows, retailers can visit our site to shop for hundreds of curated makers that they can try out totally risk-free. This revolutionary offering has drawn over 65,000 retailers to the Faire platform in less than a year after our launch.

Our founders led product and engineering for Square Capital ($10B deployed) and the Cash app (Square's only app in the top 20 of the iOS app store). We're backed by some of the top VC funds including Sequoia, Khosla, Forerunner and Lightspeed; and we were named one of the top 20 YC companies by valuation ( https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/ ) last year.

We are looking for smart, resourceful and passionate people to join this movement with us.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.
About the Role

As the PM for Geospatial platform in Search & Places group, you would lead the team and efforts responsible for the bread and butter of Uber as a service - how users set their pickup and dropoff location.

These platforms set the foundation to answer complex questions like: How do we build a platform that determines and serves the best pickup & drop-off points across all Uber products (riders, drivers/couriers, eaters, bikers and freight users)? How do we improve our understanding of user location accuracy (walking/in-train/stationary, side of the street, in-door/out-door, localization, etc)? How do we best communicate location information and pickup/dropoff points meaningfully to all consumers (“Rider is standing next to Chase ATM on 11th & mission” for example).

You’ll work as the product owner for these platforms, while also liaising with engineering, business development, legal, data science, and many other teams to deliver magical experiences.

The role demands technical depth, principled thinking, well-honed product instincts, a refusal to settle, true innovation, and a high-quality bar for what goes out to the world.

Craft a coherent product vision, strategy and roadmap for the Geospatial platform at Uber
Internalize and deeply understand Uber's products like Pool, UberX, Eats and how they rely on core pickup and dropoff platform and then align your team's mission and roadmap with this direction
Execute. This means being constantly biased towards action, knowing the data, being in the details, setting a high bar and building strong collaborative relationships with other teams, thinking boldly, disambiguating, always thinking of the customer first and rapidly iterating towards something demonstrably awesome
Vision. Think outside the box. Imagine what core services the world would need tomorrow when we have self-driving cars and other innovations. How would you build today’s capabilities that become tomorrow's differentiators?
Drive cross-functional team to set qualitative objectives and quantitative goals
Partner with engineers, data science, research, and other PM stakeholders to understand how we can better meet user needs & expectations.
Understand, synthesize, and help set the strategy for pickups & dropoffs as a broader tech team.

Minimum 5 years experience delivering highly successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them - and you're deeply proud of what you've accomplished
Experience applying Machine Learning / statistical inference technologies to a variety of complex problems
Entrepreneurial spirit and a thirst for learning
Computer science undergraduate degree or equivalent, ideally including hands-on software engineering experience. Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the metal
""Driver"" personality. You are biased toward action, a great collaborator, a master disambiguator/simplifier, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery
Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and take on something hands-on.
High emotional intelligence. You're able to lead, coach and share feedback with positivity and optimism. Experience managing other product managers, growing their careers and improving their performance.
About the Team

Search & Places team works on building the best Geospatial platform for ride-sharing and delivery use case. It helps powers magical pickup and dropoff experience across Uber products (Rider, Eats, Driver, etc).
