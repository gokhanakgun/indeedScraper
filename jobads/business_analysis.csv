WHY CISCO
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box.
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Business Analyst Job Responsibilities
If you read our business analyst job posting and thought, “That sounds great, but what is this job actually like?”, then keep reading!
The core function of our role as business analysts at Grant Street Group is to be a liaison between our developers and our clients, and this requires us to wear many different hats.
So what do all of these “hats” really mean?
Problem Solving: Every day you work to solve complex problems. When you analyze a calculation, investigate the cause of a bug, or propose a new process you are venturing into unfamiliar territory to find a solution. Our clients and developers rely on your problem solving skills to ensure our software is built and supported effectively.
Client support: When a customer has a question, problem, or suggestion, they come to you! You are known as a subject matter expert and our clients rely on that expertise regularly. Whether the issue is major or minor, you know that Grant Street Group takes Software as a Service literally.
Prioritization: Our software is ever-changing. With that comes the need to prioritize what, when, and how changes are made. Since you’re working with the software and our clients daily, who better to prioritize than you? Business analysts are constantly asking themselves: Does this feature need to be completed before a certain time? What is the impact of this bug? How can other clients benefit from this change? We use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes. We then prioritize them for developers to work on.
Technical Specifications: It’s your job to convey to the developers what changes need to be made. What happens when you click this button? What does the page look like? How is this file transferred to an external system? In this way, you are directly affecting the product and our clients’ experience.
Testing: When a developer completes a change, you get to test it out (in a beta environment) to ensure that it’s working correctly. Does the new behavior match the specification? Does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly?
Implementations: We’re a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth! Since you’re a subject matter expert, you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs. Think of yourself as a consultant. What business processes does the client need to accomplish? How can our software fit in with and help that process?
Training: Helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role. Whether it’s a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed, or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process, you’re a resource for providing the information and tools they need.
Does this sound exciting and overwhelming at the same time? Most of us thought so too. If you haven’t had experience in this area before, know that many of us lacked business analyst experience before we came to Grant Street Group. What we did have was intellectual curiosity and a passion for problem solving. If you’ve already had business analyst experience, that’s great, and we’re excited about the possibility of you continuing on that path with us.
So now that you know what we do, why are you a great fit? You’ve probably spent a large majority of your life asking “Why” and then making sure that you figure out the answer. You love using all parts of your brain equally, and the thought of speaking with a client or learning about a database schema equally intrigues you. You’re the one that people rely on in team projects. You’re always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard.
Before you begin the interview process, keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that put in extra effort in their applications. We are radical proponents of the belief that you are more than just a resume. If you’re excited about this opportunity, we can’t wait to get to know you!"

Rover.com connects pet parents with the world’s largest network of pet sitters and dog walkers. On Rover, pet parents can easily discover, book, and manage personalized care for their dogs including pet sitting, dog walking, and doggy day care. Founded in 2011 on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the unconditional love of a dog, Rover improves and simplifies life for pet parents and the dogs they love.
Our global headquarters are in Seattle, Washington in the United States, working closely with our teams in Spokane, Berlin, London, and Barcelona. We have a track record of being recognized as a great place to work, having been named among Seattle's 'Best Places to Work' in Seattle Business Magazine and the Puget Sound Business Journal for three years running. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies. Our pioneering approach to people and pups alike landed us on the list of GeekWire’s Next Tech Titan in 2019 and the World's Most Innovative Companies in 2018 by Fast Company. Needless to say (but we're going to say it anyway)—we love dogs, and we wouldn't dream of going to work without them by our sides.
Who we're looking for:

For Business Analysts at Rover, there is no such thing as a boring day. They easily transition between supporting the quantitative needs of one specific business unit (Marketing, Finance, Supply, Operations, etc.) and working cross functionally to tackle more complex problems such as acquisition and retention forecasting, ROI reports, and supply/demand equilibrium monitoring. They are also a source of support and mentorship for colleagues across the organization as they hone their own analytical skills. Business Analysts dig deep into huge sets of customer, sitter, and market-level data, then emerge with clear business narratives and recommendations. They will work closely with business stakeholders to provide actionable insights.
Why we’ll hire you:
You are a thought partner for business owners. You are relentless in getting to the question behind the question and distilling the underlying need to analyze data.
You are scary good with data. You look at charts, furrow your eyebrows, and observe that something doesn’t seem quite right. Others see trends; you see outliers.
You examine and question data insights and don’t take anything at face value. You understand that strong recommendations require an intricate understanding of both the data sources you are working with and the broader business context.
You have deep empathy for the business owners you will support. You understand at a cellular level that people have jobs to do and decisions to make, and it is your job to help them do that in as data-driven a way as possible.
You thrive in the dynamic environment of a hyper-growth startup. You unblock blockers, take initiative, and move things forward despite the real world of imperfect information.
You are excited to design and measure tests. You are able to transform an ambiguous idea into a thoughtful, detailed hypothesis test that will inform future strategies.
Your Responsibilities:
We are specifically looking for a Business Analyst to support the Growth product team. The analyst will:
Support A/B tests and ensure that best practices are being followed so that we can make accurate and impactful decisions.
Provide feedback to the business regarding demand capture, funnel conversion rates, channel attribution, and product changes.
Establish and maintain reporting that provides insight into customer acquisition.
Providing explanations and recommendations based on test results or analyses.
Perform ad hoc analysis to support Growth product managers in developing new features
Your Qualifications:
At least 2 years experience working cross-functionally with real-world, complex datasets.
A college degree with coursework in a quantitative field. You don't need a degree in STEM, but familiarity with quantitative concepts and methods is a must.
Two-sided Marketplace experience preferred.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Specifically, you know how to narrate results to business stakeholders and executives in a useful, concise, and actionable way.
Experience working with data infrastructure / engineering teams to assist with recommendations for organizing data into performant tables.
Familiarity with digital customer acquisition. You can explain the difference between SEO and SEM.
Your toolset includes:
SQL: you are fluent and would feel comfortable heading a SQL 101 course.
Fundamentals of hypothesis testing: experiment design, data sufficiency and statistical power, A/B testing, understanding of meta-significance, etc.
Your Bonus Skills:
Python, R, or a similar computational language
Periscope, Tableau, Looker, or similar data visualization tools.
Benefits of Working at Rover.com:
Competitive compensation
401k
Stock options
4 weeks paid time off
Competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision insurance
Commuter benefits
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Doggy benefits, including $1000 toward adopting your first dog
Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats (for humans and dogs)
Free catered lunches semi-monthly
