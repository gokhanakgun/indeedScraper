The Data Scientist will report to the Global Chief Technology Officer.
In order to make the models relevant to a specific customer, the successful candidate will have to work with data that considers the current cyber threat environment globally, the customer’s exposure to those threats (in terms of their technology infrastructure’s configuration) and the financial losses that those threats could cause. Since the models are of a range of possible attacks, considering the personality and motivation of the attacker, as well as the possible responses from the company, the models must produce a range of outputs at different probabilities.

The Buzz on Nehemiah Security

Nehemiah Security is a fast-growing cybersecurity software company with a passion for building great software. We are leading the way in transforming how companies manage their cyber risk. Here’s what’s important to us: our people, adding value to our customers, innovation, creativity, hard work, persistence, fearlessness, speed, passion, faith, and teamwork.

Designing models that can produce both the magnitude and probability of a company incurring indirect, longer term losses related to reputation damage
Designing sensitivity models that can capture the financial effect of the theft of an organization’s secrets
Working with the other members of the data science team to build a complete set of models that consider the types of attack, the personalities and motivations of the attacker, the customer infrastructure’s resilience to those attacks and the response of the defenders within the customer
Working with the developers and subject matter experts in cybersecurity, IT and business infrastructure in order to design and specify the required inputs to any models, and how to go about gathering them from the customer’s environment or the global threat landscape
Working with the development and architecture teams to take proof of concept models and productise them
Working with the QA team to ensure that the outputs of models can be tested and validated when in production
This is a research role – the models that are built as part of this job will go into production in the RQ product. There are significant challenges to overcome in building models that will operate both in a realistic challenge and can operate at scale.

What We Are Looking For In You
A strong background in mathematics (ideally with focus on probability, linear algebra and graph theory)

About This Role

Very is a remote-first company, meaning we don’t have a physical office, and you can work from anywhere in the continental United States. Your home, a co-working space, on the road, you name it. If you feel like moving, you don’t have to change jobs.

As a Senior Data Scientist at Very, you will work with our Software, Hardware, and Product Design teams to build full-service solutions for our clients.

Ruby on Rails
Serverless

You don't need to be an expert in these tools, but familiarity is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here.

How You’ll Be Compensated

We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect your base compensation to be somewhere between $105,000 and $130,000 upon joining the company. We also offer performance bonuses, a generous maternity/paternity leave policy, 401K matching, and numerous other employee benefits including reimbursement for home office equipment and gym memberships.

330|Data Scientist, Simulation & Policy|"Our Vision

For over one hundred years, cities have managed their streets with concrete, paint, signage, and signals. The last ten years have seen a dramatic degradation of cities' ability to manage the movement of vehicles in the public realm. The tools currently available to them to fight back are not comprehensive enough, largely proprietary and have done a poor job of solving for the real issues.

Lacuna is working directly with cities to establish a new, digital environment that will allow them to effectively manage the public right-of-way for the next 100 years. This will result in a digital infrastructure that will fully support 21st century mobility – for everything from scooters to AVs to drones and flying taxis. We aspire to be uniquely city and public friendly -- we want to build this future on a foundation of open source and open standards, with privacy- and society-first principles from the start.

We are housed at Playground Global, an incubator with fantastic facilities, near the Cal Ave train station in Palo Alto, CA.

By working in close collaboration with colleagues that can build production-grade software systems implementing your methods and tools, your work will have an almost immediate impact.

What you'll need

Master's degree in Computer Science, Transportation Engineering, Operations Research, Mathematics, Statistics, or a related technical field (Ph.D. preferred).
Advanced knowledge of optimization and statistical methods, with a focus on transportation applications.
Experience working with geospatial data and developing visualizations.

335|Geospatial Data Scientist|"Hello!

Airspace Link, Inc. is hiring a Geospatial Data Scientist to help build the tools used to manage local airspace, commercial drone logistics, and beyond visual line of sight operations. Yes, the jetsonian-future is finally upon us and we need help creating the future of unmanned aerial vehicles!

This is a role for someone with experience manipulating large and diverse datasets with the know-how to coax data diamonds out of the rough. This is the first offering of this type within our organization and will report to the CTO.

Airspace Link is headquartered out of Detroit, MI with a remote office in northern Utah. We’d love for candidates to be centered in these geographic regions but understand that the best person for the job may live somewhere else. In short, the right remote candidates are considered, however Detroit based candidates will be given preference. International candidates are not considered at this time.

We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are eager to further diversify our company. Airspace Link is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.

About The Job

The Geospatial Data Scientist will be part of an agile team responsible for deriving risk associated with the potential of drone operational failures. The more these vehicles go up, the more likely they'll come down, and our mission is to build the best probability models in the industry. Risk can be quantified by a wide range of external influencers, including both predictable and unpredictable (e.g. weather) aerial and ground-based factors.

If you're digging the autonomous future, this role is for you. You will be directly influencing the ability for autonomous drone operations to be a successful national integration, instead of a tragic news headline.

You'll be working with a diverse set of authoritative geospatial data provided through our clients, in conjunction with public and other 3rd-party datasets to help build our data product and solution offerings.

Your output will be shared via application programming interfaces (API), web and mobile applications, single-use digital maps and reports, or even simple internal spreadsheets. We'll ask you to participate in the preparation and staging of the data across a range of computing solutions.

Automation will play an important role in the success of this position as well. Can you scale the probability of an autonomous aerial vehicle striking a human or vehicle in any geography in the nation?

About You

Everyone at Airspace Link is here to do the best work of their career, so we work on systemic problems and try to avoid individual blame. We're committed generalists, eager learners, consciences workers and curators of what's essential.

We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: do go good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.

You'll be expected to come to the table with commercial and academic experience in data science, data mining, statistics (including probability theory), graph algorithms, machine learning, and spatial optimization. That's to say, there will be alot of hard problems to solve and you'll need a strong and diverse toolbox to get the work done. As an expert, you'll be expected to recommend and execute on overall modeling strategies with confidence and a well conceived notion on how to succeed.

You are thoughtful in the evaluation of your models, improving them over time as they interact with real users.

Some of the bullet points:
Proficiency with Esri software suite, including raster analytics
Strong analytic, cartographic, and presentation skills
Ability to develop robust data queries using SQL
Graduate level competency in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or equivalent scientific field
Some experience with cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc)
Excellent coding skills, especially in Python or R

About Our Pay & Benefits

Airspace Link, by all definitions, is a startup. Some of you may look on our status like you would at grabbing the last Walmart shopping cart with the askew front wheel. Others will view this as a unique opportunity in a greenfield industry with huge potential upside. We hope you’re the latter.

We aim to be competitive but won’t be making any headlines [yet]. We offer a full health benefit package that is tiered depending on your tenure with Airspace Link. In other words, our benefits move from good, to better, to best.

We support a life well lived away from work. None of our benefits are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, fitness, wellness, and healthy living.

How To Apply

Please send an application tailored to this position that speaks to us. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us the future.

We value good communication and solid writing is part of that. We expect to see a well-constructed cover letter along with your professional history. Forget the generic resume (and it's so blatantly obvious). There's no prize for being first. Copy and paste doesn't make it very far and we strongly encourage you to take this part of the application process seriously.

In case this job gets crawled and posted somewhere unexpected, you may or may not have an ""apply now"" link, but ultimately you should end up applying here: https://airspacelink.com/geospatial-data-scientist/

Top-notch benefits (healthcare, vision, dental, maternity, paternity, retirement)
A unique opportunity to use your leadership skills, experience, and contacts to build a team and shape the culture of the company.
An incredible team of fun, humble but brilliant co-workers

Background
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.
But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.
Our Company & Culture
We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.
Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.
Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody."

542|Data Scientist, Admissions|"What We Do

Y Combinator (YC) is a startup fund and program. Since 2005, YC has invested in over 2,000 companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, Instacart, and Docker. These companies are now worth over $155B combined. YC has built programs that support founders throughout the life of their company. Many of our services were created by YC alumni who later became YC partners — so, we understand the challenges involved with building a company. We help founders navigate their biggest challenges — from learning how to start a company, to finding customers, to raising funding and hiring their first employees, to raising a Series A and scaling beyond.

About the role

Twice a year, we receive tens of thousands of applications from promising startups all around the world. Reviewing these applications is one of the most important aspects of YC’s business. The ideal candidate will be a software engineer first, data scientist second. You will be the point person for data pipeline, analysis and modeling efforts, primarily focusing on admissions data. While fundamentally a technical role, promising candidates should also be excellent communicators, proactively seek out strategic opportunities to improve processes, and be open to doing non-technical tasks like reviewing applications and interviewing startups.
In this role, you will support efforts in the following domains:
Build new admissions software features
Conduct exploratory analysis on admissions data to inform strategic decision making.
Collaborate with software engineering to maintain and extend existing data infrastructure.
Build machine learning models to support admissions processes.
Develop internal tools for parsing unstructured data.
Understand the admissions pipeline and determine new ways to improve data collection, search and review.
Review startup applications and interviewing founders
We’re looking for someone with:
Interest in fields at the intersection of computer science / statistics / social science
Knowledge/experience with standard ML toolkit, both unsupervised and supervised modeling techniques.
Experience / interest in NLP technologies.
Strong software experience, ideally in Ruby/Rails and Python.
3+ years of software engineering experience.
At least one year of professional data science experience.
Good communication skills (written/verbal).
An interest in startups
The ideal candidate is self-motivated, independent, and passionate about using data to answer interesting questions to find promising founders and make YC the best experience for them. Strong candidates will be comfortable with handling a diverse set of tasks - from modeling the expected number of applications in a given batch to building the software that handles those applications, to actually reviewing them.

We are looking for someone senior enough to know best practices, but still excited to get their hands dirty. You should understand and know how to choose the right tool for any given data problem, even if that tool ends up being a survey or talking to users face to face. YC started as a family business, and we look for low-ego people who prioritize getting the job done over tool or title.

This is a good job for someone who is excited about startups and interested in learning more about them. You’ve likely worked at or started a startup, or want to do so in the future.

Location & Benefits

The YC admissions team is based in downtown SF. We can help you move here, but don't hire people who can only work remotely.

We offer highly competitive compensation (even with the top tech companies in the valley) and even equity in YC. We also offer full benefits that you might expect from established companies, including top healthcare benefits, 401k matching, generous parental leave, commuter benefits, catered lunch, and a flexible vacation policy."

We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers – you know – GEEK OUT. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?

We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

We've raised over $40M, and in the past two years, we launched the product and have since processed over 1 billion communication data points and generated 4+ million introductions and connections while capturing close to 40% of the global venture capital market. We are also actively breaking into new markets. We're growing fast and we’ve got a lot left to build.
