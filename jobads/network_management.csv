#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

563|Network Administrator|"If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new, welcome to the party....you will notice that I like to add humor to my job descriptions...so you will see (hopefully) some chuckles as you read this.
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom. I am Partner & VP at RSM Solutions, Inc. About 95% of my time is spent 'customer facing'. That being said, I am going to be far more interested in 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. This also means that their are no 'layers' between me and any of my clients as well..I am direct to all my clients.
This is a role where a social and work ethic fit is almost as important as the technical fit. You will be working with a close personal friend of mine...someone that I have known (and am proud to call my 'friend') for about 15 years. He is an emotionally mature leader (in other words, not someone that is going to scream at you or make you a scapegoat for every problem that comes up), and someone that would never ask you to do something he would not do himself. This is a small team...so that ability to be self-sufficient will be necessary for success. Your immediate hiring manager (he reports to this friend of mine) is a very talented Network Engineer and someone that you will be able to learn from as your career continues to grow.
There are a few key characteristics we are seeking in candidates for this role:
1) That ability to not just understand the 'how' when it comes to working in those key Network Administration tasks, but also understands the 'why'... So, for example, I am certain you know what DHCP is...but do you understand why it works the way it does?
2) We aren't working with nuclear weapons here or avoiding the next Zombie Apocalypse...so this is an environment where their is limited - if any - drama. If you are the kind of individual that believes the world revolves around them, you may want apply to the Kardashians instead.
3) We are seeking a good 'generalist'...someone that has a good broad base of knowledge and doesn't need a lot of hand holding...yes, hand holding can be fun with a significant other, but we need some self-sufficiency in terms of the ideal candidate for this role. If you are the kind of person that enjoys 'figuring it out', we are definitely off to a great start.
4) We are seeking someone that can dig into stuff that they don't necessarily have a ton of direct experience with. For example, if someone comes to you with a question 'We have this problem, can you help us with three or four ways to solve it?'...can you help them solve it (not only drawing upon your experience, but drawing on brainstorming as well).... No, we aren't looking for the next Einstein...he would probably cost too much anyway....but, if you think in the 'hmm...have we tried this?' type of format, we are definitely off to a great start.

They are emotionally mature, easy to work with, and the kind of company that wants you to succeed. This is a role for the kind of individual that understands the ‘what’ when it comes to ‘what to do’ when it comes to those common Network Administration tasks. However, we also need that same person to understand the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ almost as much as the ‘what’…so, for example, it is great to know what DHCP is, but we also will need you to know how DHCP works (for example, the ‘why’ and the ‘how’). This is a role for someone that enjoys working with end users as well…this is an environment where everyone gets along with one another as well. So, part of this role will include those lovely help desk tasks as well. Is all of your job going to be held desk activities…no… it will be Network Administration tasks. But, it is inevitable that you will need to work with end users on issues that come up.
Here are some of the responsibilities for this role (I have a lot more to share, but this should give you a good idea of what we are looking for)
You will be responsible for installs, configuration, and maintenance / repair of network infrastructure and applications (applications from a perspective of the network administration impact on those applications).
Help desk support & troubleshooting of remote access (VPN), hardware, software & peripherals. Is all of your job going to be help desk tasks…nope, but you will need to jump in and assist when needed.
Installing, maintaining, upgrading & configuring LAN hardware, apps, printers, servers, routers, switches, bridges, modems & cabling.
Establishing & maintaining networks & user accounts, passwords, directories & security. This also includes administration of data backups when needed.
Training & assisting users in MS Office and other apps as required (from a network connectivity perspective).
Testing & installing software upgrades for servers & desktops.
Here are the requirements (I am going to be far more interested in depth and breath of skills as opposed to years of experience):
1) At least 3 years of Network Administration Experience. This experience should include: Windows Client OS; Windows Networking; Server Administration; AD Administration; Layer 2 Switching; and IP Routing & Name Resolution
2) At least 3 years of Help Desk Support experience. If you have progressed from a Help Desk individual to a Network Administrator, that would be wonderful to see.
3) The following are ‘nice to haves’: Azure Administration; O365 Administration; and Hyper-V Administration
4) This client likes to see certifications…so, let me know if you have MCP, MCIPT, MCSE or MCSA certifications. If you are working toward any of these certifications, that is something I would want to know as well.

628|Network Administrator|"JOB FUNCTION/PURPOSE
The Network Administrator role offers a unique engineering experience for someone who enjoys supporting client networks. This role is a member of the Managed Services department and our engineering team. No client has the same exact network setup. Every client has their own budget, objectives, obstacles, etc. The primary responsibility of this position is to review client networks and assess their alignment with the “Lanspeed Way” – core standards and best practices that we have established.
This role is very proactive in that Network Health Reviews are scheduled out in advance. Network Health Reviews are primarily conducted in person, so regional travel is expected on a daily/weekly basis to meet with prospects and existing clients. The Network Administrator will complete monthly Network Health Reviews for their assigned accounts and submit the completed reports to the Technology Consultant for review. During a review, the Network Administrator will have the opportunity to build a technical relationship within the account, resolve some minor technical issues, verify that Centralized Services are working properly and perform scheduled maintenance. The Network Administrator is the voice of our client. The scheduled Network Health Reviews are full days dedicated to one account.
This role is responsible for keeping up-to-date records of client accounts in ConnectWise to set the Service Desk Support team up for success. You will have a direct impact on the client's ability to make technology decisions and to accomplish their goals. This position is responsible for growing and strengthening relationships with existing Lanspeed clients.
The successful Network Administrator will:
Build technical relationships within existing accounts
Drive down reactive customer service requests through alignment and maintenance efforts
Will develop intimate knowledge of the client environment

Client Relationships
This person is a key point of contact for their clients. They are responsible for developing and maintaining a positive technical relationship with them. They can receive, resolve and escalate technical issues that come up during regular client meetings. The Network Administrator is a voice for our customer from within the company.
Network Health Reviews
Responsible for creating monthly Network Health Reviews for assigned accounts. Meetings are typically performed in person, but can be performed remotely and require a full day. This time is used to review technical alignment, perform maintenance, resolve technical issues, update documentation, ensure that Centralized Services are working and document suggestions for improvement. The Network Administrator “playbook” will be used to track progress.
Customer Service Training
This position will have the opportunity to teach clients how to work with Lanspeed support. The Network Administrator will need to redirect support requests through the appropriate channels and help with customer expectations regarding the support process.
Documentation
The person in this position will go on regularly scheduled client Network Health Reviews and use a “playbook” to track all activities on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. They will adhere to existing company procedures through activities, service tickets and opportunities in ConnectWise and remain compliant with our defined policies and procedures. Responsible for entering time and expenses in ConnectWise as they occur.
Technical Training

Our philosophy is to foster strong relationships with fellow teammates and customers, create an unrivaled work environment, and provide an outstanding customer experience. We are looking to expand our IT support team with the addition of a Service Desk Administrator (SDA), which is essentially a senior level helpdesk tech, but before we get into what the job is, let’s start with why you would want to work with us!
First and foremost, our culture: We have worked very hard to create a culture of unity, transparency, and trust. Our leadership team wants you to be successful at Convergence, and we will do anything we can to support your personal and professional growth.

A company-matched 401k plan that is designed to help you meet your retirement goals.
Some of the absolute best health insurance plans available for you and your family (at a very low cost to you).
Outstanding teammates; we’re very selective to make sure we have the best staff available for you to work alongside!
Many teambuilding and company events throughout the year so you can get to know your teammates on a more personal level, as well as kick back and have some fun (families are oftentimes included as well).
Relaxed work environment; hope you can handle a Nerf shooter! We cut loose with Nerf wars on Friday afternoons…we know you’ll be in the office most of the time, and we want you to enjoy yourself and experience what it’s like to be a part of the Convergence family.
As for the position, our SDA will be responsible for providing an unparalleled customer experience by responding to and resolving incoming IT requests and alerts from our customers over the phone, through email, and in person. This job operates at a very fast pace, and you must be comfortable handling high volumes of request tickets and phone calls. This position is similar to a Help Desk Analyst or Jr. Network Administrator, and offers many opportunities to advance within Convergence. If you’re ambitious, motivated, and up for an exciting challenge, then we’d love to hear from you. That’s the exact type of person that will thrive within our company!
Now here’s all the formal stuff below…
What do our SDA’s do?
Typical working hours for the SDA are Monday through Friday, 8am – 5pm. Occasional evening or weekend work will be necessary. On average, you will be working 40-42 hours per week.

Your primary responsibility will be answering a high volume of inbound phone calls from clients and performing initial troubleshooting on tickets.
You will focus on resolving tickets on the first call, but also be able to determine when issue scope requires that a ticket be escalated to a Network Administrator or other support resource.
Other relevant job duties as assigned.
What skills do I need to be a successful SDA?
Patience, empathy, confidence, and customer service skills. You will be working with a myriad of businesses, technologies, applications, and personalities.
Exceptionally strong IT background with a focus on network support, implementation, and remote as well as onsite support.
Experience with administering current Windows desktop operating systems, Windows server operating systems, Exchange, Office 365, and a variety of backup solutions, routers, firewalls, and virtual/cloud-based technologies.
Apple OSX and iOS experience.
Ability to work effectively within a team as well as independently.
Understanding of managed services and the value offered over a typical break-fix environment.
Excellent communication (verbal and written) at all levels internally and externally, interpersonal, business management, time management, and developmental skills.
Skilled at defusing high-stress situations and facilitating resolution to technical problems.
Willingness to learn, adjust, and grow with our company.
Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.
Self-starter with a positive attitude.
What are the qualifications I need to have?
High school diploma or equivalent.
4+ years of relevant experience which may include Help Desk Technician, Help Desk Analyst, or Tier 2 (or similar) in a tiered environment.
Excellent troubleshooting skills with IT and related hardware and software components (PCs, laptops, servers, firewalls, switches, routers, hard drives, Windows operating systems, etc.).
Previous experience providing both onsite and remote/phone support in a fast paced, high volume environment.
What qualifications would really help set me apart from other applicants?
Associate’s degree or higher in Information Technology.
Understanding of, and a background in working within the IT managed services provider business model, particularly in an IT support role.
Experience with ConnectWise, Kaseya, or other similar MSP tools and software.
Knowledge and experience working with Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure and other Cloud service offerings.

This position requires standing, walking, sitting, using hands, seeing, reaching, talking, and hearing. May need to occasionally lift and/or move up to 50 pounds.
Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.
How often will I get formal feedback on how well I’m doing?
Six-month performance reviews, with every second review a performance and salary review.
Performance review goals will be established between team leader and employee.
How often will Convergence get feedback on how we're doing for you?
You will receive a 60 day check-in after your start date to ensure that we have properly set you up for success; how was our onboarding process? Did we show you everything you needed to know to do your job well, or did we miss something? You will have an opportunity to share this so we can course correct as needed, and refine our process for future employees.
You will also receive an annual stay interview to offer totally unfiltered, honest feedback in a 100% safe environment. We use this data to make sure we keep doing what is going well for our team, and find ways to keep improving ourselves.
Your Team Leader will have regularly scheduled 1:1 meetings to discuss how things are going on a regular basis, so you'll never been left wondering.
The Leadership Team regularly takes employees out to lunch, even if you don't report to them! We want all employees to have a strong relationship with leadership, and what better way than to break bread.
Does this sound like something you’d be a good match for? Then let’s talk! Please email your resume, along with your cover letter, telling us where you’ve been, where you’d like to go, how you can help us, and how we can help you get there. We look forward to hopefully meeting you!"

Our clients (mostly in Berkeley and Oakland) typically operate networks of 40 to 100 computers, predominantly in a Windows and Microsoft Office environment. We work primarily with non-profits and value a diverse workplace. Our goal is to provide a highly-capable IT department to organizations where IT is a fundamental requirement and a strategic priority but not a core area of expertise. Join us in doing IT and doing good: you'll see the impact of your work.

We are seeking a person with a broad background in Information Technology to join our firm in providing contracted IT support, development, and integration services.

The ideal candidate will be both a generalist and a specialist, able to contribute depth in his or her focus areas and also able to support the full gamut of IT services with assistance from our technicians and other specialists.

Our firm provides contracted IT services for clients, primarily in the East Bay, who have chosen to outsource all or part of their IT departments. Generally our clients are firms whose primary mission is not technology but who recognize that advanced, integrated, and dependable communication and information systems are key to realizing their primary mission. Through service-level agreements, we allow them to focus on results instead of on managing their own IT staff and infrastructure.

This is an ideal position if you are someone who has been the sole technical support person of a small firm or large group and you want to join a team of people who understand and appreciate what you do. Or, if you've been a successful IT consultant and want to continue your client relationships while at the same time having the support of a team to enable you to truly develop and focus your specialist skills.

We are primarily focused on small- and medium-sized business and primarily Microsoft-focused. Our services include everything from network design and cabling to website-, database-, and application-development. The trust of our clients is our most protected asset, so we're seeking candidates with great communication skills and an over-developed sense of personal responsibility, who can inspire and continually earn that trust.

This is not an entry-level position. You should have prior significant responsibility managing and delivering IT services and be comfortable supervising the work of others. You'll need to be able to both take and give direction and to constantly keep your team up-to-date. Time management, the ability to triage and prioritize, and the ability to recognize and pursue opportunities are all key. These are big shoes, but if you're the right person and have mastered more than one IT niche, you'll recognize these shoes because you're already wearing them!

Salary commensurate with skills and experience.
