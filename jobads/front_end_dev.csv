193|JavaScript/Front-End Developer|"Full Beaker is looking for a passionate and enthusiastic JavaScript/Front-End developer to join our team! We are a small but mighty company that focuses on helping consumers make informed decisions.

We are currently focused on two areas: helping people obtain or refinance mortgages, and helping nurses find jobs. We maintain a highly-collaborative environment where everyone is encouraged to take initiative and own the solutions to the problems they identify. We believe in hiring smart people and supporting them while they do great things.

What you'll do on a day-to-day basis

Build new features and products
We have tons of ideas that need to be prototyped, tested, and eventually released.
Support and improve existing websites and products
We're currently in charge of multiple websites, products and development stacks, and they all require maintenance.
Help us make smart architectural decisions
We want our products to be scalable, secure, and distributable, which is why we strive to make smart decisions when building things.
Communicate, communicate, communicate
Everything we do has an impact on the business. You will be working directly with product managers, campaign managers, business analysts, UX designers.
To succeed in this job, you'll need:
Experience with modern JavaScript. We use JavaScript all the time, and we've started building some TypeScript applications. We don't expect you to know about the latest ES9 proposals, but solid fundamentals are required. We mainly use React, but experience with Vue, Angular, or similar is a plus.
An eye for design and good UX. We believe that good design is the best way to communicate with our consumers, so we value a critical eye and a people-focused perspective. You must be able to translate design to responsive HTML/CSS (Sass/Scss).
An understanding of the concept of generated static websites. You know the advantages and drawbacks of building static websites, and you've dabbled in Hugo, Gatsby, Jekyll, Next, Metalsmith, or any other static site generators.
The ability to work with APIs. You will be asked to integrate with dozens of different APIs — both internal and external — so it's important that you're comfortable doing so.
The willingness to learn everything. We do have a few legacy code base to maintain. Keep an open mind, be patient and pragmatic — we refactor systems if they'll improve the developer experience or add value to our business.
The best things about this job:
You'll work in a safe and open environment with talented people who have a broad range of experience.
You'll enjoy creative freedom when building new things and improving existing products.
You'll be supported, but never micromanaged.
You'll be encouraged to learn: we provide a $1500 budget per year that covers books, courses, and conferences.
We provide full-time employees with full benefits including medical, dental, and vision coverage with available coverage for close family members.
We also provide a matching 401(k) program, performance bonuses, 3 weeks of paid vacation, 12 weeks of paid parental leave, and a sick PTO policy that boils down to ""don't come in until you feel better"".

About Datamarx
Over the last decade the internet has veered away from its original purpose as a tool for frictionless collaboration + morphed into primarily a source of exclamatory publishing, for linear commentary or entertainment purposes. Any attempts at creating a network community have resulted in the 90-9-1 rule—creating an unsustainable, top-heavy user base where less than 1% of users actively create new content, and the overwhelming majority (90%+) are passive viewers/consumers.

Datamarx is a digital economy, designed to democratize data collection and facilitate real-time collaborative decision-making.

Since then we have provided over $140 million in incentives through these competitions. Each prize has created an industry-changing technology that brings us closer to a better, safer, more sustainable world.

The use of incentive competitions, or prizes, to accelerate innovation goes back over 300 years, to when the British Admiralty launched the Longitude Prize in 1714 to find a better way to navigate our seas. In the years since, several well-known innovations have resulted from incentive competitions, including canning as a form of food preservation (a competition launched by Napoleon in 1795), modern plastics (the Billiard Ball Prize, 1863) and commercial aviation (the Orteig Prize, 1919).

About HTI Labs
HTI Labs fights human trafficking, sexual violence, and domestic violence by creating sustainable, data-driven research and technology in collaboration with community partners.
Everything we do works toward two goals.
1. Develop the infrastructure for automated, ongoing data collection for prevalence estimates, trends, research, and evaluation. Many different entities track some facet of domestic and sexual violence, but to date it has been unclear whether and how these efforts come together to create a complete picture. We seek to systematically address this by:
Linking existing data on known cases. We integrate agency systems to produce reliable aggregate data tracking incidents through the criminal justice system & onto services.
Measuring & creating data on what we don’t know. Not everyone who experiences sexual violence reports the experience. We create data that doesn’t yet exist to help identify the victim population we’re not seeing.
2. Build sustainable solutions to identify victims and hold perpetrators accountable. Front-line efforts hit the same walls over and over again – unless victims come forward with a smoking gun, you are often left with a “he said / she said” situation. There are many ways that technology can be leveraged to break through those walls and to assist survivors, whether or not they decide to interact with the criminal justice system.
Building a better investigative model. We work with law enforcement to leverage forensic and digital evidence in order to shift the burden away from victims.
Creating more effective victim identification, response, & support. We work on legislation to create protections for victims as they interact with the system and develop software to facilitate and develop better community-wide processes.
We work to make data gathering processes more efficient, to link data to create a holistic picture of the system, and to build tools that make data useful to community partners fighting sexual violence on the front lines. Whether building natural language processing systems that allow us to interpret open-source data, a dashboard to display system-wide data on domestic violence, or frameworks to automatically generate statistics needed for valuable federal grants, HTI Labs builds tools to help connect the dots.

At Carvana, we sell cars, but we're not salespeople. Since 2013, we've been making it our mission to change the way people buy cars. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way, so we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T"").

With the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device. All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right). By putting customer satisfaction at the core of our business, we've built a no-pressure, no-haggle online car buying experience that save our customers time and money.

608|Full Stack Front End Developer|"At Ajira AI, we focus on developing smart products that leverage ai algorithms. We build complex cloud based and mobile business applications. However make no mistake, we solve very significant systems problems along the way. Our products work across our customers ecosystems to help people.
We’re very pleased to be expanding our development team. We’re a close knit group of innovators that have previously launched very successful start-ups. Our track record of building successful technology businesses and reputation is helping us grow and we’re now looking to add an experienced Developer to our team.
You have extensive experience with front end development using frameworks such as Aurelia/AngularJS/Vue/React. If you have some hands-on experience with UI Frameworks such as Semantic UI that is great. Any experience with C#.NET and NodeJS is welcome. You are the kind of developer that other developers seek out to solve their technical difficulties. You keep up to date with what’s happening in the front-end world and know the differences between ES5, ES6 and ECMAScript 2018. You know the limitations of TypeScript. You are motivated to learn new technologies.
That’s a high level summary of what we’re looking for but before we dive into the detail, you’ll probably want to know who you are going to be working for and what your work environment will be like:
Who we are:
We are an early stage start-up with a core mission of leveraging ai algorithms and techniques to solve complex business problems. We like to think that solving these business issues for our customers helps make them better at serving their customers. Some of our applications help people who may be injured or have been in an accident. In our opinion that’s a worthwhile pursuit. While our current business vertical is insurance, we see our technology expanding to other business verticals with time. Our founders have a solid track record of starting technology companies and making them successful.
We love what we do and not the least of which is that we have the opportunity to try out and ‘play’ with the latest advances in tools and technology.
Who you’ll be working with:
We are a collaborative, tight knit group of contributors. While we’re headquartered in the Chicago area in Lisle, we have remote developers as well. We have decades of experience working with remote team members. We’re looking to expand our Developer positions in Lisle, Illinois.
You’ll find our CTO a joy to work with; someone with excellent technical skills, always willing to mentor, roll up his sleeves and get deep into the technical issues. He possesses rare technical insight and no matter the day or time he’s always willing to contribute to move things forward. Our CEO is a rare combination of technical and business skills with remarkable vision and the ability to easily cut through the most complex issues to find the simplest answer. You’ll be working side by side with them and the rest of our technical team in what will be an amazing opportunity for you.
Your work environment:
We are a group of talented and dedicated individuals and though we are a start-up, we have a ‘no insane hours’ rule.
We would prefer that you are able to work in the western Chicago burbs. Maybe you work downtown currently and have had it with the traffic, noise and long lines everywhere. In any case, after an initial settling in period when we would want to work in person in our office, we offer the ability to work remotely a couple of days a week so long as you are able to demonstrate that you are able to manage your work effectively.
We are not clock watchers. If you need to take off for a couple of hours to visit the doctor or dentist, go ahead. We look at what you’re accomplishing not how many hours you spend in the office.
Our work is performed using the latest technology and tools. We’re constantly innovating and improving our delivery capability by building our own components and tools as well as licensing new tech that we’ve tried and works in our environment.
We are an open, collaborative work environment and suggestions are not just welcome, they are appreciated. You’ll find our product roadmap is exciting and full of opportunity.
Your skills:
You keep up with technology changes and trends
You are a top notch Developer whose code not only solves complex issues but is written in such a way that the rest of your team is able to understand. This means that you’re not shy about documenting your code
You are motivated. You have amazing debugging skills and are quick at identifying and fixing bugs
You are skilled with ES5 & ES6, TypeScript and a minimum of one of Aurelia/AnjularJS/React/Vue
You understand MVVM thoroughly
If you are experienced in C#.NET that’s preferred as is any hand-on with NodeJS and Semantic UI
Any SQL database experience is a plus as is any background in math
You have developed, implemented and supported a complex business application

Every moment of downtime matters, which is why Zinier exists.
Zinier empowers organizations to work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep people in the rhythm of their days.To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.

You follow the heavy-hitters and trailblazers of the industry and take advantage of the wealth of knowledge being shared by the web community, but you also know when to tune them out and blaze your own darn trail.
What You Won't Be Doing
Slicing comps.
Minding your own business and punching your timesheet at the end of the day.
Working in a silo or on a pixel assembly line.
Getting by as just another cog in the machine.
What You Will Be Doing
You'll be responsible for shaping how we approach front-end development at Lifeblue. The future depends on you. You will...
Build the front end of our websites with über-semantic, insanely accessible HTML5.
Add some richness to the site with a scoop of Microdata.
Beautify it with modular, efficient, responsive CSS3, compiled from a pre-processor like LESS.
Boost that sucker with a dose of clean, lickety-split JavaScript.
Ensure your code's standards-compliant and cross-browser compatible – and if you think that means it all has to look the same in every browser, you've got another thing coming.
Control all that deliciousness using a version control system like Git.
Your job is not limited to pixels and tags. You will also...
Be involved in site development from the beginning stages.
Sketch a lot, so hone your UI/UX/IxD/WTF skills.
Contribute to content strategy and creation.
Meet with clients over the phone and in person, presenting site prototypes.
Come into contact with some back-end code (PHP) in the process, so the more you know, the better.
Be sincere about giving and receiving meaningful constructive feedback, and on board with the concept of Radical Candor (http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/).
Exhibit that general awesomeness that makes you ""You.""
Why You'll Be Doing It
What you really came here for: the perks. At Lifeblue we offer:
The opportunity to save the world from bad design
Competitive compensation, profit sharing, health/vision/dental benefits, 401(k)
3 months paid maternity leave, 1 month paid paternity leave

A casual-dress, and a results-only work environment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROWE)
Camaraderie with a team of exceptional people that balance truth and passion
A constantly collaborative environment
Video games, office music, board games, group events, team sports, and a great sense of camaraderie to help keep everyone sane and foster their creativity & productivity
The opportunity to shape the company – we need your expertise
A culture that fosters growth and pushes you to reach further personally and professionally

626|React Native Front End Developer|"Saggezza is a proven technology and consulting partner that delivers personalized, high-value solutions to accelerate business growth. We consult, create experiences, analyze, modernize and digitize to help our clients adapt and transform the way they do business. Saggezza consultants work as part of a global team, and throughout their tenure, have the opportunity to work on a variety of different projects across various clients and industries. We are chartered to do one thing, and one thing only – to bring enabling technology to our clients that allows them to move their business forward.
The Role
We're looking for a mid-to-senior-level front end developer comfortable to join a small team working in the React Native ecosystem.
We're compiling for both Android and iOS, and as such we'd hope you have experience with both as well. In joining this team, you'll be working with other developers on a completely new code base. Ideally, you'd feel comfortable defining and enforcing best practices, and working without heavy reliance on other developers. As it's a new code base, communication protocols haven't been defined, but at a minimum you should feel comfortable consuming RESTful endpoints. GraphQL is a bonus, but not required.
Key Responsibilities
Apart from the everyday requirements of this role, ideal candidates should be well-rounded front-end developers. You should be comfortable working closely with designers and UX researchers - capable of providing guidance when needed or clarifying the feasibility of proposed designs. Ideally, you'd have experience receiving mockups in InVsion, AxShare, or something similar, but this isn't a deal breaker.
You should be able to demonstrate strong CSS skills and should have experience working with some version of precompiled CSS, such as SCSS or LESS. We'd hope you've been leveraging version control to handle parallel or coordinated development efforts on the same code base. Ideally, you'd feel comfortable configuring development scripts and tools through NPM, Gulp, or some other task runner, along with at least a basic understanding of the Webpack ecosystem. Experience in any CMS or ADA compliance knowledge would be a great bonus as well.
This is a client facing role, and as such, we strive for great client service along with strong communication and interpersonal skills. You can expect to interact with clients on a daily basis, and as you'll be writing the occasional report, documentation, or presentation, solid oral and written communication skills are essential.
What You Will Definitely Need
Deep level expertise of React Native (Android & iOS Compilation)
Comfortable Enforcing Best Practices
RESTful Consumption
CSS (Precompiled: SCSS or LESS)
Version Control (Git, SVN, etc.)
Strong Oral/Written Communication
What We Would Love to See
Experience with the following:
InVision, AxShare, etc.
GraphQL
Code Cleanliness (eslint, Prettier, etc.)
Content Management Systems
ADA Compliance
Scripting (NPM, Gulp, etc.)
Webpack Configuration
MVC Frameworks (React, Angular, etc.)
Component Libraries (Storybook, Styleguidist, etc.)
Don't tick all the boxes? Don't worry about it: we still want to hear from you if you think you're the right person for the job.
