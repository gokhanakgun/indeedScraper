Work with our broader engineering group to ensure products fit into the company’s product lineup
Work iteratively to hone proofs-of-concept for new product features and steadily merge development into the overall product
Keep attuned to the marketplace and spot opportunities to expand functionality in response to new technical capabilities as they arise
Keep attuned to customer use and actively work to improve product experience to meet usage, both current and future usage the customer may not even realize they need

Qualifications
Technical Degree in Computer Science, Operations Research, Statistics, Math, Physics, or equivalent
5+ years of Python development experience
Proficiency working in Linux development environments
Experience in structured work environments with automated-testing and quality processes
Experience developing REST APIs
Familiarity with SQL and databases

Bonus Qualifications:
Familiarity with Container Orchestration (Kubernetes specifically)
Strong communication skills as demonstrated by personal projects, technical blog postings, volunteer activities, etc.
Interest in Machine Learning and Data Science
Experience working with highly complex technical ecosystems (resource managers, containers, automated testing - e.g., Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker)
Familiarity with popular python libraries (NumPy)
Understanding of the data science ecosystem - commercial and open source
Participation in hackathons; wins at hackathons or Kaggle leaderboards are even more impressive
Experience working with computational systems (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Spark, etc.)
Applicants are encouraged to share online project/code portfolios and any demonstrations of community participation (e.g., public Github profiles, public StackOverflow profiles, public Kaggle profiles, technical blog postings, etc.)

BS/MS degree in EE/CS with 5+ years of experience We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

406|Sr. Full Stack Python Developer (Auth Focused)|"Overview:
Medal is looking for an experienced individual to join the Development Engineering Team as a Sr. Full Stack Python Engineer, with a focus on AuthZ. As a member of Medal Engineering, you will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of our technical infrastructure as well as laying the foundation for improvements. We also hope you enjoy what you do, as you will have the opportunity to grow your skills, learn new things, and walk away each day with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.

Who are you?

At Medal, we value teamwork and relationships. We're not looking for rockstars or gurus, instead we'd like modest team members who share information, contribute to our common knowledge, and are always working to improve both their technical and soft skills. We work hard, have fun, and understand work/life balance; you should too.

In order to run smooth, finely-machined code you'll need to be neat, organized, and have a great sense of humor, both in person and in your code. There are no instructions. We expect you to have real-world problem solving skills and be able to think on your feet. We also work with, and advocate for, FLOSS technologies, and our infrastructure primarily rests upon Linux.

What would I be doing?

Here are some of the types of things you can expect to do on a day-to-day basis at Medal:

Help us design, build, streamline, and maintain the authorization framework for our web applications. You will have the opportunity to put your mark on this, and it would be your domain. We're a fairly small team, so you'll also have the opportunity to contribute across the stack.

Lead our effort to implement role-based access control (RBAC), along with object-level permissions in our Python-based web apps [Django, Flask]. We're in the process of updating our authorization framework and integrating with Okta, you will play a crucial role in this process.

Task and review work for a team of in-house and contract engineers. Provide technical thought leadership in your areas of expertise and mentor the technical teams who need assistance in your areas of expertise.

Since building reliable scaling systems into a platform from the ground up offers fresh new insights, we'll also want you to build performance, unit and regression testing into your code

Like everybody at Medal, we ask that you share in the responsibility of the uptime of the systems that you're responsible for; including on-call when necessary.

Every business has compliance issues to consider, and your code will be written to necessary HIPAA and HITRUST standards for security, privacy and audit.

Your work will help us achieve high standards for uptime and meet SLAs. Hopefully you'll enjoy breaking things and then learning from it. We love to ask ""what could possibly go wrong"", then solve for it.

Qualifications:
As a Medal team member, we would expect you to be proficient in the following skills in order to be successful in the role:

We're primarily a Python shop. You will need 5+ years of proven experience building and bringing products to market as a Python engineer, using a mainstream Python web framework (Django or Flask). Experience implementing RBAC in conjunction with OpenID/OAuth2 or SAML is a necessity. We're using Okta for identity management, so experience with Okta is a huge plus but not a hard requirement.

You will want to take the lead, think creatively, and work collaboratively. As a critical team member you will be happy to share and mentor when possible and to listen to options and advice while helping to guide our team as one of our experts.

Of course, you'll need familiarity with the major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google. It's important to understand how cloud infrastructures fit together.

You'll definitely need to know how to interact with the databases and REST APIs that contain our data.

Nice to haves:
We understand that job descriptions can turn into a magical fairy-land of expectations and wishful thinking. We're realists about this, so here are some things that it would be great if you had familiarity with or some exposure to:

It would be great if you have experience working with Okta and federated login.

Experience working with Django REST Framework would be really excellent.

General knowledge around APIs and Micro services.

Security is everybody's responsibility so you'll need to understand security concerns and how your role interacts with those. We're specifically talking about how role-based access systems work: users, permissions, roles, and groups.

Benefits:
Great medical, dental and vision insurance
401K
Stock options
Twice weekly onsite catered lunch
Free refreshments on site"

414|Python/Django Developer|"ONeil Interactive is a team of 16 creative and technology professionals working tirelessly to build incredible software, design ground-breaking websites, and architect powerful marketing programs. We’re growing fast and we need to add good people to the team.
What’s it like to be on the team?
Our company culture has been described as “high-performance, low ego.”
Our Python/Django Developers have a standing weekly meeting to review active projects, discuss solutions, review commits, and seek feedback. Communication, however, is far from limited to that alone, and ad hoc huddles and advice seeking happens almost daily.
There are opportunities for all to learn from teammates and to share their own knowledge. Some team members have been developing in Python and/or Django for nearly a decade, while others are front-end web developers who need advice on the best solution to a simple need.
We have a weekly all-hands meeting where a team member casually shares some practical knowledge over lunch, and once a month we all share over a show-and-tell session.
We work a split schedule of onsite days (Mon, Wed, Thur) and remote days (Tue, Fri) to support collaboration, serendipitous discoveries, and quiet focus.
Our Python/Django team performs a mixture of client work and long-term product roadmap enhancements.
Our next Python developer could be described as follows:
You appreciate efficient, but human-readable code. You know that others are working alongside you and respect the need for all developers to understand the how and why of your contributions.
You seek to understand how your contributions impact the whole. It’s important that you know not just how your code may alter an application’s behavior, but also how it might impact what users are expecting, or not expecting.
You appreciate constructive feedback, and listen without prejudice. You have opinions on the best way to do something, and are prepared to support those opinions, but can identify a superior solution when presented, and adjust your thinking.
You understand the balance between giving a user what they’ve asked for, and guiding them to the solution they need.
You want to be a part of a committed team of professionals where big egos are forbidden and high-performance is a requirement.
If this sounds like you, please introduce yourself and submit your questions, your resume, and any public code repositories. We look forward to meeting you.

We are a small, fast growing team and we have many cool, challenging problems to solve.

If you were here the last few months, you would have worked on:
Revamping our entire analytics infrastructure, including integrating Segment, Klaviyo, and AWS Glue/Athena.
Refactoring how we handle products in our online store from scratch, replacing huge parts of a live system with minimal downtime.
Worked closely with the business to make our support processes more efficient, having a huge impact on your colleagues' daily work.

Work on new software and online initiatives that are yet to be announced.
Play with and give feedback on unannounced super-secret hardware products coming out next year.

Why you should work here:
Love what you do - This isn't some B2B app or SaaS targeted at an industry you have no real interest in. We're a company making products for gamers, and are active participants in the gaming industry. If you are interested in consumer electronics, gaming, or something related - you will love it here.
Many cool technical problems to solve - Our tech team is small and tightly knit. We work on all kinds of projects, and there's always a new challenge coming up.
Make an impact - We are a small company, so if you like being able to make an impact on a daily basis - this is your place.
Be part of Product Development - Feel strongly about what makes good gaming gear? We'll listen to you. We are a very open organization and everyone has chances to see how consumer electronics products are built and what goes into bringing them to market.

Qualities we'd love to see:
Advanced experience with Python.
Advanced experience working with an MVC framework (Django, Flask, Pyramid - we use Django.)
Experience with test driven development.
Solid JavaScript/HTML/CSS fundamentals (being able to work on the full stack is definitely a plus, but not a requirement).
Experience using payment system APIs like Stripe, Braintree, Paypal, or experience integrating other REST APIs.
Working knowledge of Python application deployment.
Degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or equivalent experience.

About us:
SteelSeries makes high performance gaming gear used by the most demanding, top professional gamers worldwide and peripherals that provide superior quality and a competitive edge to gamers of all skill levels.
What originally began with two people who recognized the need for superior, high-quality/performance gaming gear that would give gamers a competitive edge, has grown into a global leader in gaming and entertainment gear sought after for their high-performance capabilities.
Fast-forward to today, and we've come a long way since our first glass mousepad. We have global offices in North America, Europe, and Asia, providing a complete portfolio of products designed for gaming.

Apply if:
You are smart, inquisitive and can get stuff done.
You want to make a huge impact and love pushing the boundaries of web and product development.
You are excited about working on, and shaping the development practices of, a small tight-knit team (currently 2 front end developers and 2 back end developers.)
You take pride in what you do and want to be part of that next great product sitting (hopefully) on the shelf at your local Best Buy.
You enjoy working in a smaller company, where your opinion matters, and helps guide the projects being worked on.

About glitchAI

AI Applications for Clear Marketing Simulation and Optimization

Understanding how marketing drives business outcomes remains one of the greatest challenges for a marketer today, despite the attention it has received over the last decade.

Historically attribution models have failed to deliver for three major reasons:

They take too long and require too many resources to build
They are too dependent on historical data and don't represent ""current"" conditions
They are not useful as tools to help manage the business
Marketers need models that can demonstrate the impact that their efforts historically have had across the whole customer conversion path and provide an environment that allows them to test new plans with the confidence that their model represents the ""facts on the ground"".

At glitchAI we believe that modeling attribution needed to change, so we changed it.

Our models can be built in days. Our models leverage data flows that exist outside your internal resources. Our models run continuously.

As glitchAI is designed by marketing operators, the difference you will experience happens because:

glitchAI understands your business outcomes and the drivers behind them
glitchAI knows better than your competitors what is driving your category
glitchAI responds when tactics go awry (glitch) and creates advantage while your competitors are still unaware
glitchAI continuously tests in simulation the likely tactics your competition can deploy"

522|Python Back End Developer|"For nearly 6 years Theia has pioneered the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and touchscreen applications for enterprise customers. As the global leader in real-time rendering software and solutions, we are proud to partner with brands like HP, Nvidia, HTC, and Epic Games to deliver stunning and innovative experiences like luxury hotel design reviews, aerospace simulation and training, medical facility walkthroughs, real estate pre-leasing tours, award-winning product demonstrations, and branded AR activations. With new technical challenges and creative opportunities happening all the time, Theia is the perfect place for passionate problem solvers from every expertise.
Job Description
Theia’s core development platform is Unreal Engine. We live, eat, and breathe UE4, and our customers depend on it for almost every aspect of their 3D production pipeline. One of its most powerful and recent features is a full-fledged Python API that lets developers script out almost all the functionality of the engine. Theia’s latest software product is a desktop application called Optim, which provides a sleek and easy-to-use user interface to automate Unreal Engine workflows via the Python API and some C++. Our visualization team, and the viz teams of every other engineering company, have historically wasted hundreds and thousands of hours doing tedious and repetitive tasks to get projects ready for real-time rendering, like deleting unnecessary pieces, replacing materials, reducing the complexity of the models, creating Levels of Detail, or even organizing the project. Optim allows even the most novice UE4 user to apply all these optimizations to a very complicated scene in minutes compared to hours because of our intelligent Rules-based system and smart presets.
As a back end developer, your mission is to get into the nuts and bolts of Optim and Unreal to bundle up the complex processes of the UE4 data prep workflow into streamlined functionality. You’ll work under our Development Manager and CTO to expose and create APIs that let our customers do their work faster and better by translating feature requests into technical executions.
Qualifications
You’ll be working very closely with a variety of 3D file formats to ensure maximum compatibility with Optim, so you’ll immediately need to develop an understanding of the 3D production pipeline. Optim is primarily built with Python and leverages Unreal Engine’s Python API, but the ability to access or expose C++ functionality will be helpful. The stability of Optim will be vitally important to you, so you should have experience integrating common DevOps practices like unit tests.
Required:
Python proficiency
Extensive experience with versioning and repositories in a professional setting
Experience building and maintaining public-facing applicationsDesired:
Unreal Engine proficiency
Experience with a variety of digital content creation packages
DevOps knowledge and experience
C++ knowledge

An interest in data analytics and management
Additional Information

We have a collaborative open office environment in downtown Chico, tons of artwork, a pool table at the center, flexible work hours and flexible work-from-home days, regular coffee walks to Starbucks, beer on Friday afternoons, and free lunches on Wednesdays.

540|Full Stack Software Developer (Python/Javascript)|"SpotOn is a fast-growing marketing, loyalty, and payments platform that helps small business owners understand and reach out to their customers and increase revenues by making informed decisions. Customers can discover businesses using our mobile apps, then at order time can check-in and pay for their orders using our mobile and tablet applications. The resulting data allows merchants to send targeted marketing campaigns, track their online reputation, and monitor the growth effect loyal customers can have on revenues, through our flagship web application.
As part of the business operations team, you would be working on various types of systems - from building APIs for exchanging data with external partners, to building web applications to manage business processes, to building out the infrastructure that is necessary to run those systems in a scalable and reliable way. We are looking for someone with at least 3 years of experience building technology solutions that have been used to solve real-world problems.
If this describes you…
You’ve seen a few projects through to completion in similar roles, and either has worked or are comfortable working with, teams of small to medium size. For most folks, this means about 3+ years of industry experience.
You've worked with frontend development to some extent. JavaScript land moves fast, so we'll understand if your background doesn't perfectly align with our stack (Riot/React+Redux+Babel+Webpack, Backbone.js), but we're definitely looking for someone who's used a modern framework of some sort, and isn't strictly a jQuery wizard.
You've worked with some kind of MVC framework.
Have an eye for idiomatic, readable, and performant JS/Python (ES6+) code, and experience with linters/debuggers/profilers/etc. which help reach these goals
Comfortable with at least intermediate-level queries in MongoDB and/or PostgreSQL. We’ll gladly teach one or the other if needed, but knowledge of at least one is a must.
Understand Git and comfortable using a branch+tag workflow model that leans heavily on GitHub’s Pull Request utilities
Bonus: Have experience with JavaScript at or after the ES6 turning point. Trust us, it's a whole new world when you're able to use `import` and `async/await`. We're of course open to teaching these new features as needed.
Bonus: Have experience with Django, Flask, or AioHTTP.
Bonus: Have experience with both Python 2 and Python 3, and can explain some of the footguns involved in moving between these versions, and in writing cross-compatible code
Bonus: DevOps experience of any form. We’re Vagrant people locally and AWS people in the cloud. Experience with Ansible or similar configuration systems would be extra bonus points.
Bonus: You’re opinionated about tooling, process, code/test styles, etc., but not too snobby about it. Our process is flexible and ever-changing, and you’d be welcome to leave your mark on it!
… then here’s a bit about what we have to offer!
Salary Range: $65k+ annually. This is based on experience and what you bring to the table
Health, Dental, and Vision insurance
Monthly commuter cost reimbursements
Company-provided MacBook Pro (or similarly-spec’d device if you’re more of a Linux type).
Reasonable work-from-home/wherever flexibility
A supportive learning environment, where you will work closely with a skilled team of software and QA engineers and graphic designers
At the time of this writing, we score a 10 on the Joel Test and are working to raise that to at least an 11 in the near future
Transfers of existing H1B visas will be considered

SpotOn will consider all applicants for employment without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender/gender identity, religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, or any other basis as prohibited by federal, state or local law.

At Carvana, we sell cars, but we're not salespeople. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way. To fix that, we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T""). We provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers from A-to-Z. From acquiring, inspecting and certifying high quality cars, to providing 360° high-resolution photography inside and outside of the vehicle, to generating real-time financing and warranty options, to providing consumers with the option to have cars delivered to their driveway in as little as 24 hours or pick-up from one of our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machines (yes, you read that right) all with a 7-day Money Back Guarantee, we've made it our mission to redefine the car buying status quo. With no dealerships or commissioned salespeople, we also save thousands of dollars per car in expenses that we pass on to our customers.

Recently named Forbes' 5th Most Promising Company in the U.S., we offer the excitement, culture, and opportunity of a start-up, with the capitalization and infrastructure of a much more established business.

638|Python Developer|"THE COMPANY
B-Stock is the world’s largest online marketplace for returned, excess, and other liquidation merchandise. Our customers range from SMB to the world’s largest brands and retailers (including nine of the top 10 U.S. retailers). Led by eBay veterans, B-Stock completes over 175,000 transactions per year, selling 90 million items annually, making us a clear leader in the space.

The amount of inventory that is returned or unsold each year is growing very rapidly; in 2018, the value of this merchandise was estimated at $500 billion. Much of it ends up being liquidated for pennies on the dollar; some of it is even destroyed or landfilled. We believe there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple and direct way to buy valuable products, and offers sellers a trusted replacement for traditional liquidation and a critical boost in operational efficiency.

Backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock runs lean, fast, and shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values (teamwork, honesty, humor, and the passion to build something great) have shaped the company we are today and will certainly drive our success for many years to come.

666|Python Software Developer|"DESCRIPTION

We’re transforming the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry with our AI platform that

improves yield and lowers manufacturing costs at some of the largest chip makers in the world. We're

looking for python software developers who are interested in implementing, improving, and scaling new

and existing algorithms using open source machine learning libraries/frameworks or writing one from

scratch. We look for some combination of: high creativity and productivity, depth and breadth of knowledge

in the field, and the ability to implement and scale up state of the art and/or unproven algorithms. You’ll

work closely with other data scientists and software engineers to implement feature engineering, data

transformations, and machine learning algorithms from scripting languages to high performance code that

can scale. We look for people who are self-motivated and passionate about the transformative potential of

AI. This position presents an exciting and unique opportunity to design/build the product and the platform

from scratch utilizing high performance machine learning algorithms, data science and the associated

frameworks.

Location: Santa Clara, CA

RESPONSIBILITIES

Implementing scalable ML algorithms in production
Improving computational performance of ML algorithms
Interact with Software Engineers and Data Scientists to create clean API interfaces
REQUIREMENTS

MS or PhD in Computer Science, OR, EE, Physics or related quantitative field
3+ years of experience in back-end development in python, ideally R as well.
3+ years of engineering experience with significant exposure to algorithm
implementation/machine learning libraries/frameworks.

Experience with relational and NoSQL databases such as Postgresql/Cassandra/Redis or similar.
Experience with API calls.
Hands-on experience with H2O framework source code/new algorithm additions etc.
Ability to analyze the bottlenecks and create high performance code.
Good understanding of CPU and memory issues in parallel computing
JOB DETAILS

This work involves building robust ML models in python and/or R to achieve desired accuracy on metrics

of customer interest (e.g. yield, tolerance). Broken into steps, the work is roughly an equal mix of tweaking

core ML algorithms for enhanced performance and creating deployment-ready software.

This role offers a unique opportunity to deploy non-trivial ML models into production and seeing the impact

of those models in action at some of the world’s largest chip manufacturers. This is not a Hadoop/Spark-

focused big data role but rather an ML-focused role. Our deployment environment is markedly different

from typical cloud deployment with constant access for updates or bug-fixes. Roughly stated, the

production requirements are closer to a self-driving robot than a cloud-integrated image recognition service.

An ideal candidate has invested time in continuous learning and implementing algorithms either using an

existing framework/library or from scratch and understands failure modes of various algorithms in

production. Additionally, the ideal candidate has collaborated with Data Scientists to put ML code into

production.

690|Backend Developer (Python)|"At Doist, our mission is to inspire the workplace of the future by creating simple yet powerful productivity tools that promote a more fulfilling way to work and live.
We're a multidisciplinary, fully remote team that’s passionate about creating products, like Todoist and Twist, that improve people’s lives. We thrive on innovating new solutions to old productivity challenges and we seek to rethink how productivity tools are made.
When you become a Doister, you’re not only joining a global, remote-first company, but a team of 70+ people who value:
Independence. Others can trust that you’ll deliver on time and your teammates don’t need to worry about you keeping your word.
Mastery. You love what you do and care deeply about the quality of your work, down to the smallest details. You’re continuously learning and pushing yourself to the limits of your ability. You're never satisfied with the status-quo.
Communication. Your communication is clear, concise, and engaging whether you're explaining a complex idea or providing feedback to a teammate.
Balance. You're mindful about cultivating a healthy work-life balance. You care about the well-being of yourself, your team and the people around you.
Impact. You're able to take a bird's eye view to pinpoint and then solve issues that have a high impact on our customers, our team, and our company. You're committed to the health and success of both your teammates and Doist as a company.
We invite you to visit our blog to learn more about us, our values, and how we work.
The Doist Backend team is looking for a Backend Developer to grow Todoist 10x and Twist 100x in five years.
How we work
In the Backend team, we take care of all server-side code, infrastructure, and API. The main product work happens inside cross-disciplinary teams that we call squads. You can read more about how we manage projects on our blog. Also, we have a rotating role of so-called Hero, whose main responsibility is to triage support issues and fix the most pressing ones. Finally, we dedicate time to housekeeping and learning. We use Twist to keep ourselves on the same page. We use GitHub pull requests to review each other’s work. Once a week, we have a video chat to discuss the challenges of the past week and plan our work.
Day-to-day work
What you can expect to do on a regular basis:
Make features. From the proposal, through specification and implementation, to maintenance. Often these features are implemented as documented API endpoints. You're encouraged to propose things that you think can be helpful for the product.
Provide feedback. When planning a feature, you are encouraged to provide feedback on expected technical challenges and unknowns as early as possible.
Improve the code. With time, our code and data structures accumulated some technical debt, which we pay off. Often we do it while we make features, but we also dedicate time to housekeeping.
Be a responsible team member. We do code reviews, refactor code, learn new things and share our knowledge.
Be a Hero. A hero is a developer whose main priority is working closely with support at triaging and fixing bug reports. Also, they help speed up reviewing processes and support other teams in their projects.
Indicators that this could be a good role for you
You feel that your values resonate with ours, and you see how they can act as guidance for your day-to-day work.
You are fluent in written and spoken English.
You have at least 2 years of professional experience developing for the web.

Besides Python, you are familiar with at least one other programming language.
You are familiar with OWASP top10 web app security risks and knows how to mitigate them.
You are familiar with MySQL or PostgreSQL. You can plan database schemas, taking performance into consideration.
You are familiar with the Unix shell. You occasionally write bash or python console scripts to automate your work.
You understand the value of testing and write unit-tests for your code.
You are familiar with best practices and apply programming principles such as DRY, SRP, YAGNI, etc to your code.
You are familiar with some software design patterns and can provide their implementation in Python.
