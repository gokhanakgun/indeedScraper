15|UI / UX Designer|"About Hive:

Hive is a full stack deep learning platform helping to bring companies into the AI era.

Two Stanford graduate students determined to build practical applications using novel deep learning technologies founded Hive (https://thehive.ai/). From the beginning, we knew that high-quality datasets were critical to creating deep learning models. However, we also knew that the quantity of labeled data also has a huge impact on model performance. With this in mind, we first started by building a data- labelling platform specifically designed to solve machine-learning problems. This platform, Hive Data, is now the world’s largest distributed human workforce for data labelling and produces millions of high-quality annotations every day. Hive Data allows us to label uncommonly large datasets at a fraction of the cost that other data labelling solutions would charge. Once Hive Data was built, we were able to quickly label enormous datasets and rapidly build a suite of machine learning models that now form our core offerings in Hive Predict.
Our Hive Predict team has since built a wide range of custom machine learning models spanning a range of verticals including media, retail, security, and autonomous driving. Drawing on this experience and expertise, we then set out to build a stand-alone analytics platform for TV advertising called Hive Media. Hive Media synthesises our company's fundamental technologies and leverages industry partnerships to deliver a truly revolutionary product. Hive offers the only true, full- stack deep learning platform in the world, assisting clients with data labelling, model building, and the development of full enterprise solutions.

Today, we work with some of the largest companies in the world to redefine how they think about unstructured visual data and together we build solutions that completely transform verticals. We are fortunate to be funded by leading investors like Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), General Catalyst, Formation 8, and others. We have over 160 talented individuals globally, based in our San Francisco and Gurugram offices.
The Role
You’ll be expected to own your space: work with all disciplines on your team to build, launch and iterate. You will work closely with the product team to conceptualize and execute on designs to solve problems for our products. This is a very rare opportunity that will put you in the position of total ownership of whole product from design perspective without the risk of starting your own company. Every designer at Hive has responsibility of a whole product, although we encourage the team to provide feedback to each other.
You are a talented designer who consistently delivers visuals and interactions of highest quality on timelines that would be unrealistic for many others. You take pride in your creative vision, execution and communication skills. You are a strong individual contributor, but also a team player. You enjoy taking ownership of full products, and are stifled by large design organizations.
You get a rush from seeing your designs live in the real world.
Responsibilities
Design projects across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches.
Work with small multi-disciplinary teams. You’ll partner closely with engineering, product, and business folks to find elegant but practical solutions to design challenges.
Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.
Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes
Job Prerequisites
3+ year of experience designing consumer and mobile products
Had ownership of many consumer products over the years, and understand what it takes to create awesome, consumer-oriented experiences
Biased toward action and execution. You get nervous if you’re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work
Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life
Constantly looking to hone your design instinct through user feedback. Whether through hands-on user research, or by designing options for an A / B test
You have an online portfolio (Behance/Dribbble) or PDF that you can share with us
What Hive offers you:

Hive offers an opportunity to work with exceptional people. We are a group of individuals who are young and hungry to make a mark on the world and build a long-term investment holding company. You will be based in Gurgaon, India Office and we offer all the standard benefits available to top startups. At Hive, you will have a significant career development opportunity and an opportunity to learn.

Thank you for your interest in joining Hive!"

32|UI/UX Designer|"The New Tech for Restaurant and Hospitality

Fourth is the first global cloud-based intelligent back office platform in the restaurant and hospitality. We’re no ordinary software company! We pride ourselves on the culture we have created and work hard to ensure this is never compromised. This is a place where our people want to work; where they enjoy and develop in their roles; where our people pull together to work as a team and ultimately be a company we are all proud to be a part of.

By developing innovative products, building relationships with our customers and enabling great careers; we are focused on building lifetime loyalty with our customers and each other. The vast majority of us have worked within the industry; we believe we need to be passionate about and have experienced the industry in order to help our customers grow their businesses successfully.

When recruiting, we look for those who want to join our journey; those who want to be a part of our personality and culture; those who are professional; have energy, enthusiasm, and ambition, are entrepreneurial and those who can show they can live by our company values each day. Working at Fourth + HotSchedules provides an opportunity to build a successful career where our people develop and grow in a dynamic, fast paced environment.

What do we do?

We design and build everything from phone-based apps for booking shifts and holidays, communications between employees and checking pay, to software for stock-taking, ordering supplies and planning menus to wall-mounted check-in stations for staff to clock in and out of work. All cloud-based, and all developed specifically for restaurants, hotels and caterers.

What are we planning to do next?

We need to combine the disparate array of applications into a coherent a suite of products that gives the customers and users as consistent a user experience as possible.

Fourth will expand the range of products further, for example to include recruitment and other packages that make an employee’s experience from application to pension consistent and high-quality.

Streamlining and improving the design and build process is also a priority, as is learning the intricacies of the business in other markets, especially the USA, where we already have a growing client base.
All of this needs significant UX Design input.

The work

What is the challenge for UX Design?

During the last year, we have had so much new code to deliver to meet our business goals that the UX team have been very stretched just to keep up with the development teams. We would now like to mature the UX function further and enable them to provide high quality UX research and insights to feed into our product roadmap and future development work – ultimately enabling us to produce better quality products that delight our customers and end users.

To do this, and to streamline our processes, we need to create a Design System and an associated UI component library that informs our work going forward and consolidates everything we already have.
We have to make everything sit comfortably together, allow users to transfer seamlessly from one piece of functionality to another and create a universal design language that makes Fourth technology accessible to a diverse user group.

Who are our users?

The hospitality business has passionate people and disinterested people, working in both complex and simple roles. People who care about the big picture, and others who just want their own hours and pay sorted as simply as possible.

The common strand is that our users are often under pressure; monetary, and especially time pressure. Many hospitality industry workers do not speak English as their first language, and they care about doing a good job more than you might expect considering their pay and conditions. However, the tasks they use our software for are never their favourite part of the job.

It is these people we have to know and design for. We have to understand their preferences and expectations as well as the context in which they will perform the tasks expected of them.

How do we work?

UX Design at Fourth reports to the Chief Technical Officer and is situated within the product team. Each of the designers has a workload for which they are responsible, but the team collaborates on everything we do. Briefs are agreed with product owners (sometimes we write them, sometimes they do), and the workload and deadlines are agreed between product management and the Head of UX.

This person we are looking for as part of the UX team (within Product) would be required to collaborate with their UX colleagues in London, but would work day to day with the developers to produce wireframes and high-quality design outputs to guide the developers. They would also have a big focus on Design QA - really the gatekeeper of design quality from development output.

What would you do, and how do we work?

This person needs to be a “do-er” – proactive and a quick worker. They need to be able to get the balance between attention to detail (to ensure the development output meets their designs) with quick turnaround and as such, they need to be pragmatic based on the type of work and urgency of it. They also need to be a “self-starter” – able to manage the geographical distance with the central team including flexibility to travel to London.

Sufficient skills in the software for creating prototypes and designs.

Patience and good communicational skills are essential, they will the daily routine. Self-organization and documentation keeping is a key, since we are responsible for the whole pipeline. From conception, trough visualization to delivery.

A technical background is not essential but would be a plus, since it will help fit in with the developer’s teams and understanding the task at hand.

We want curious, creative, confident and energetic people. We need people who are happy to promote their ideas within the group, and listen to others as we work to build a consensus on the best approach. We don’t expect any particular technical skillset beyond the norm, but want to hear about what you’ve got and what you want to do. We do want people who don’t mind getting their hands dirty and are ready to join in and get the job done.

What You’ll Get From Us

Be part of a growing Agile community;
Receive coaching, support and training;
Team centric atmosphere;
Competitive salary package;
- Brilliant working conditions - new office and regular events;
Encouraging healthy lifestyle and work-life balance

37|Senior UI/UX Designer|"The New Tech for Restaurant and Hospitality

Fourth is the first global cloud-based intelligent back office platform in the restaurant and hospitality. We’re no ordinary software company! We pride ourselves on the culture we have created and work hard to ensure this is never compromised. This is a place where our people want to work; where they enjoy and develop in their roles; where our people pull together to work as a team and ultimately be a company we are all proud to be a part of.

By developing innovative products, building relationships with our customers and enabling great careers; we are focused on building lifetime loyalty with our customers and each other. The vast majority of us have worked within the industry; we believe we need to be passionate about and have experienced the industry in order to help our customers grow their businesses successfully.

When recruiting, we look for those who want to join our journey; those who want to be a part of our personality and culture; those who are professional; have energy, enthusiasm, and ambition, are entrepreneurial and those who can show they can live by our company values each day. Working at Fourth + HotSchedules provides an opportunity to build a successful career where our people develop and grow in a dynamic, fast paced environment.

What do we do?

We design and build everything from phone-based apps for booking shifts and holidays, communications between employees and checking pay, to software for stock-taking, ordering supplies and planning menus to wall-mounted check-in stations for staff to clock in and out of work. All cloud-based, and all developed specifically for restaurants, hotels and caterers.

What are we planning to do next?

We need to combine the disparate array of applications into a coherent a suite of products that gives the customers and users as consistent a user experience as possible.

Fourth will expand the range of products further, for example to include recruitment and other packages that make an employee’s experience from application to pension consistent and high-quality.

Streamlining and improving the design and build process is also a priority, as is learning the intricacies of the business in other markets, especially the USA, where we already have a growing client base.
All of this needs significant UX Design input.

The work

What is the challenge for UX Design?

During the last year, we have had so much new code to deliver to meet our business goals that the UX team have been very stretched just to keep up with the development teams. We would now like to mature the UX function further and enable them to provide high quality UX research and insights to feed into our product roadmap and future development work – ultimately enabling us to produce better quality products that delight our customers and end users.

To do this, and to streamline our processes, we need to create a Design System and an associated UI component library that informs our work going forward and consolidates everything we already have.
We have to make everything sit comfortably together, allow users to transfer seamlessly from one piece of functionality to another and create a universal design language that makes Fourth technology accessible to a diverse user group.

Who are our users?

The hospitality business has passionate people and disinterested people, working in both complex and simple roles. People who care about the big picture, and others who just want their own hours and pay sorted as simply as possible.

The common strand is that our users are often under pressure; monetary, and especially time pressure. Many hospitality industry workers do not speak English as their first language, and they care about doing a good job more than you might expect considering their pay and conditions. However, the tasks they use our software for are never their favourite part of the job.

It is these people we have to know and design for. We have to understand their preferences and expectations as well as the context in which they will perform the tasks expected of them.

How do we work?

UX Design at Fourth reports to the Chief Technical Officer and is situated within the product team. Each of the designers has a workload for which they are responsible, but the team collaborates on everything we do. Briefs are agreed with product owners (sometimes we write them, sometimes they do), and the workload and deadlines are agreed between product management and the Head of UX.

This person we are looking for as part of the UX team (within Product) would be required to collaborate with their UX colleagues in London, but would work day to day with the developers to produce wireframes and high-quality design outputs to guide the developers. They would also have a big focus on Design QA - really the gatekeeper of design quality from development output.

What would you do, and how do we work?

This person needs to be a “do-er” – proactive and a quick worker. They need to be able to get the balance between attention to detail (to ensure the development output meets their designs) with quick turnaround and as such, they need to be pragmatic based on the type of work and urgency of it. They also need to be a “self-starter” – able to manage the geographical distance with the central team including flexibility to travel to London.

Sufficient skills in the software for creating prototypes and designs.

Patience and good communicational skills are essential, they will the daily routine. Self-organization and documentation keeping is a key, since we are responsible for the whole pipeline. From conception, trough visualization to delivery.

A technical background is not essential but would be a plus, since it will help fit in with the developer’s teams and understanding the task at hand.

We want curious, creative, confident and energetic people. We need people who are happy to promote their ideas within the group, and listen to others as we work to build a consensus on the best approach. We don’t expect any particular technical skillset beyond the norm, but want to hear about what you’ve got and what you want to do. We do want people who don’t mind getting their hands dirty and are ready to join in and get the job done.

Be part of a growing Agile community;
Receive coaching, support and training;
Team centric atmosphere;
Competitive salary package;
- Brilliant working conditions - new office and regular events;
Encouraging healthy lifestyle and work-life balance

Optimus Ride is a self-driving vehicle startup working to enable safe, sustainable, and equitable mobility solutions. Our mission is to transform cities and pave the way for a more sustainable future through the introduction of self-driving technologies.

Optimus Ride headquarters are located in the Boston Seaport District. Our team hails from a diverse set of backgrounds, and cumulatively has decades of experience building self-driving vehicles, electric vehicles, manufacturing robots, surgical robots, autonomous drones, underwater robots, and more. We aim for a highly collaborative, hands-on, and open environment where peers learn from each other while building technologies for real-world environments.

Transportation is for everyone, and we create a better product when our team reflects our users. We constantly strive for a culture where under-indexed groups are welcome and can flourish.

The Role
Working with Optimus Ride's product team under the guidance of our Product Designer, the UX Designer Intern will help us refine the experience passengers will have in our self driving cars. From the design of digital interfaces that enable rides to be scheduled or monitored to the experience of sitting in a car without a steering wheel, the UX Designer Coop will think creative and critically about the processes, prompts, and experiences passengers will have as they travel in self driving vehicles.
Requirements
You're a good designer (but that kind of goes without saying)?
And you want to get better (none of us are perfect, and we like to embrace our shortcomings by tackling them head on).
You're a junior designer, and want to build on your experience gained through undergraduate coursework, design bootcamp, or other internships.
Your design execution and aesthetic choices elevate the product you are designing for.
You're comfortable with Sketch and other digital design software, including the Adobe Creative Suite.
You love post-it notes (and the types of design thinking activities that accompany them).
You enjoy getting feedback from users and colleagues during all phases of the design process.
You're not afraid to ask tough questions, even if the person you're asking is one of our (five!) co-founders.
You feel just as comfortable talking about unknowns and BIG IDEAS as you are obsessed by the smallest micro-interaction.
You know when something is good enough, even if it's not perfect.
You know a good screen when you see one: web, mobile, or large format, none of it scares you. But you're also excited to dabble beyond digital interfaces, including audio, hardware, and vehicle interiors.
You're motivated by a fast-paced, dynamic environment where you get to work with creative technologists and engineers who are at the top of their field.
You have an interest in product design, but you don't want to be siloed into one part of the design process. You're also open to brand, marketing, and anything else that comes your way

Please note: This is not a design research position. While we value user research and testing, this role is primarily an execution role. Therefore, more weight will be given to visual design when reviewing portfolios.
Benefits and Working Environment
At Optimus Ride, we strive to support our employees by offering competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits and a world class working environment that is centered around the team. We nurture creativity and provide expansive opportunities for growth and development."

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

100|SENIOR UX DESIGNER|"3Pillar Global is searching for a Senior User Experience Designer to help create outstanding digital products for our clients.
We are 3PILLAR GLOBAL
We build custom software for private-sector clients. Typically these software products a) generate revenue; b) touch our clients’ customers; and c) exist in a fairly competitive space, i.e., our clients’ customers have a range of products to choose from, so our work really needs to stand out.
Oftentimes we research, design, and build brand new products, but some clients also engage us to rethink and redesign existing applications.
Our clients expect us to be comfortable balancing design with business and technology perspectives, to understand how the design decisions impact these two dimensions in order to build a successful product, and to effectively collaborate in an agile or lean approach.
How We Think and Work
We are an agile shop. Most of the time our UX team works together with a 3Pillar Engineering team, operating in two-week sprints. Some principles that we live and work by are:
Build the right product: we endeavor to create products that will have the greatest business impact for our client, and offer the most value to their customers;
Excel at change: we’re skilled at changing course or shifting gears based on changes in assumptions, budget, goals, or other factors;
Minimize time to value: we strive to get a useful product to market in the shortest amount of time. Ask us just how short a time that can be.
Our Client Engagements
We work on a wide range of projects, and for a lot of us, that variety is a big part of the attraction of 3Pillar. You could be designing a B2B app, or maybe B2C. It might be for the financial industry, or media, healthcare or automotive, just to name a few of the verticals we work in.
Current and past clients include: Calvin Klein, Carfax, Common App, National Geographic, PBS, Next Day Blinds, NPR, and Parkmobile. There are others we can’t mention here but would be happy to talk about in person.
Device-wise, here too the theme is variety. We build a lot of web apps, but quite a few smartphone apps as well, often integrated with a web app.
QUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
We’re looking for a designer with 6+ years of experience working on complex digital products, who has the following UX skills and abilities:
Color: You know how the color palette can affect and shape users’ perception of a product. You’re an expert at using gradients and drop shadows, background colors and whitespace. And you know how to ensure sufficient color contrast throughout your work.
Typography: You’re skilled at choosing typefaces that complement the product and brand. You’re experienced at putting together a typographic scale to ensure optimal typographic harmony. And you’re reasonably familiar with web-hosted font platforms.
Iconography: You understand how the right icon set can express the personality of the brand or product so powerfully. You may even have experience creating custom icons.
Motion and animation: You love crafting interactive behaviors that engage and delight users, and stay up to date on the latest techniques.
Pixel precision: You’re a stickler for getting everything aligned exactly right. Column and baseline grids are your bread and butter.
Design systems: You have helped create and implement design systems for previous clients.
Generating ideas: You’re good at leading the design process in a collaborative manner with cross-functional teams, gathering many ideas, and building upon each other’s ideas in an iterative way to come up with the best solutions.
Understanding users: You’re able to gain a deep understanding of user needs and goals, communicate with cross functional product teams, and apply principles of design thinking and agile to create engaging user experiences
Teamwork and Communication Skillset
Teamwork: In some cases you might be the sole designer on an engagement, but usually you’ll be working with other designers, and almost certainly with either a product manager, an engineering team, or both. You’re adept at expressing your point of view in a professional manner, and at treating your teammates with respect.
Communication: You’re good at getting your point across, in speech and in writing, and at providing or requesting information at the right time to keep your work moving ahead.
Working with Clients: You experienced at presenting your work, anticipating questions or concerns, explaining trade-offs, and receiving critical feedback. You have a good understanding of the broader landscape on the client side that may affect the overall design direction, and how to navigate your way through it.

Our Toolstack
We’re looking for designers who are familiar with these tools (or comparable ones):
Sketch
Marvel
Abstract
Framer or other prototyping apps (bonus)
OUR VISION
We value great product minds, consulting skills, and business knowledge over specific technical experience.

UX Designers in the Advertising Design and Experience group (the creative team within Amazon Advertising) are responsible for contributing to the development of large-scale campaigns that focus on Amazon customer solutions, while simultaneously meeting advertiser goals. They periodically partner with a small internal creative team to achieve this goal, but are primarily self-sufficient. Additionally, a UX Designer must be able to provide direct feedback when working with motion and narrative content, technology, media, and strategy.

Under the guidance of a Creative Director, UX Designers investigate Amazon/3P data to generate insights based on observed customer behavior. And, through a deep understanding of Amazon’s suite of tools and services, they recommend a campaign framework that balances advertiser goals with customers’ expectations of frictionless commerce.
The ability to operate within one or more broad verticals is expected, and the UX Designer will therefore need to understand the nuances of these verticals. Partnering with Sales, Product specialists, Campaign Management and Technology teams, the UX Designer will act as the creative hub, ensuring that the concept remains intact, and that the customer experience is protected at all times.

In order to be successful, our UX Designers are expected to:

Earn Trust
Understand everyone's motivation, not just their behavior. This applies to customers, partner teams, leadership, clients, and yourself
Build relationships and align efforts with internal business partners: sales, campaign management, custom, design technology, product
Communicate early, often, and concisely
Learn and Be Curious
Amazon moves fast. Keep up to date on product and program developments, both within and outside Amazon Advertising
Follow the culture of advertising outside of Amazon to quickly identify new opportunities for Amazon Advertising to develop product/program solutions
Know the tools (research, tech, and measurement) that power the digital advertising marketplace both on- and off-Amazon
Dive Deep
Use data to develop hypotheses about why certain customer behaviors exist. Use those to generate powerful insights that drive your campaign ideas
Learn the potential (and limitations) of the Amazon Advertising toolset. If gaps exist, fill them
Understand the metrics that measure the success of your campaigns, and the levers that affect them
Invent and Simplify
Develop campaign ideas from the bottom up, not top down. Think: solutions first, not stunts
Create campaigns that balance advertiser goals (KPIs) with customer goals (frictionless commerce)
Participate in the development of solutions that help customers make better, faster purchase decisions on Amazon
Think Big
Create SMART goals that deliver against team-wide objectives. Determine the priorities and prescribe the processes needed to achieve these goals
Don't just make advertising; create work that has an impact, and which elevates Amazon and our advertisers to being a part of culture
Develop and foster ideas that are novel—and which are uniquely Amazonian
Insist on the Highest Standards & Be Customer Obsessed
Make work that matters by putting yourself in the customer’s shoes; if you wouldn’t read/watch/use/share your campaign, they won’t either
Ensure flawless execution, from exquisite design, to on-time, error-free delivery
Make every client meeting the best meeting of their day
Take Ownership
From concept to execution, know the tools, steps, and policies of the products you deploy
Solve problems when you can, only escalate when you can't

Self-starter
Proficiency in industry standard software
Data-driven and obsessed with measurable impact of a campaign
Experience as a Creative Director at either agency or advertiser
Experience as a Strategic Planner, Copywriter, or Art Director at either agency or advertiser
Excellent presentation skills and interactive storytelling ability
With strong portfolio which demonstrates account/campaign planning, creative direction, visual design skills, and interactive/digital advertising experiences

You will work with our design, product and development teams to come up with simple and effective design solutions.

What we're looking for
You have at least 3 to 5 years of experience as a professional user experience designer working on web or mobile products or services. We love recent grads and people looking to change careers; however, this role requires experience.
A portfolio that showcases your UX chops and product design skills. We’re looking for product design work, not websites or marketing collateral.
Ability to think high–level about product strategy and vision and translate those into design solutions.
You are self–motivated and able to take ownership of a project from start to finish
Excellent communication skills and able to defend the design decisions you make. You’re able to take people along on the journey with you and explain how what you've designed should be implemented, verbally and in specifications.
Mastery of Sketch or similar design tools (we use Sketch) and experience with InVision or similar prototyping tools.
You have opinions, ask smart questions and champion new ideas, but you leave your ego at the door. Ain't nobody got time for that.
You’re curious. You continually iterate and improve your designs, skills, and processes, and you like to help the rest of your team level up.
Experience with the agile / scrum way of working — including Design Sprints and epic/story writing

Bonus Points
Rise toward the top of the list if you have some of these items:
You have experience in planning, conducting, and reporting on various research methods such as usability tests, split tests, ethnographic interviews, and card sorting.
You can build prototypes in Framer, React or basic HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Key Results Areas
The most important tasks that we do each day to win:
Usability Research and Testing: Work with Product, clients and stakeholders to understand detailed requirements and validate your designs. Use whatever tools that are in your arsenal to understand user motivations, habits, and workflows.
Identify design problems and devise elegant solutions: Design and deliver wireframes, user stories, user journeys, and mockups optimized for our product and interfaces. Work with developers to explain how the end result is supposed to work and control the quality of the implementation.
Maintain Design System: You will be responsible for maintaining and contributing to the company design system — ensuring that look and feel across our products and deliverables are consistent and on-brand.
Champion Design in our organization: Continue to promote the value of good design, advocate for design and user research best practice across the organization, and continue to build our design culture and systems."

305|Senior UI Designer|"Description
Meow Wolf is an art production company creating and operating immersive, interactive multimedia experiences that transport audiences of all ages to fantastical realms of storytelling.

Founded in 2008 by a small group of artists, writers, musicians, and makers looking to create an egalitarian space for artistic expression, Meow Wolf’s first exhibits were created in warehouses on shoestring budgets. Since then Meow Wolf has created 25 exhibitions throughout the United States working with hundreds of artists.

Can you incorporate the surreal and experimental into usability? Can you make the other-worldly stay grounded? How do you provide navigation through a world that doesn’t have to make sense?

Meow Wolf is seeking a Senior UI Designer to create simple, elegant, and intuitive interactive interfaces for our core digital products: our websites, in-exhibition narrative software, creative displays, and mobile applications.

As Meow Wolf expands into more technologies, you will help to define a brand new digital layer of the Meow Wolf universe. This role will take the art, stories, and experiences of Meow Wolf and help create a new interaction paradigm for our guests/participants.

This role is focused on visual interactive interface design: how users interact with devices, how users process information, and ultimately how Meow Wolf’s digital products “look” and “feel”. Core to this role is the creation of UI in a visually systematic way that ensures a holistic, consistent experience across our products, while still incorporating the experimental, playful, and genre-bending style of Meow Wolf.

Besides exceptional UI and interaction design skills, success in this role is dependent on being highly self-motivated and managed, super organized, always open to feedback/critique, and extremely collaborative.

The Senior UI Designer works directly with the Product and Project Managers, Digital Director, UX Designer, and Engineers to create customer-facing visuals that present Meow Wolf as a world-class creative organization.

About Sitetracker
Sitetracker was founded seven years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the #2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people-first culture."

COMPANY
LendingTree is the nation’s largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices.
Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.
What else you should know:
We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials.

IT Group Description
The UX team within Bernstein’s Digital Client Strategy group is a small team immersed in the world of investing for individuals and families, as well as investment support technology, with resources at our fingertips to learn even more about the world of global finance. We’re led by a Service Designer/UX hybrid and our commitment is to ensure user-centered thinking is a driving force behind our company’s technology decisions.
Responsibilities:
We are seeking a User Experience Designer to join the Bernstein Digital Client Strategy Group’s UX Team in New York, NY or Nashville, TN.

Describe the role:
The User Experience Designer will be a generalist responsible for driving forward UX research and design on new features and products being developed for external (client) use as well as internal (employee) use within Bernstein. This role collaborates heavily with developers, project management, business analysts, business stakeholders, our product owner, and our end users in an agile process, to deliver high-quality and timely user research and product designs that meet user needs while balancing business and technology goals. This is a UX generalist role, and we are looking for someone who wants to work in the entire UX spectrum from user research through to UI/visual design.
Describe the applications and business or enterprise functions the role supports:
Private wealth client-facing technology (app, website), internal technology used by associates and advisors to conduct business. Our team’s UX designers are helping to ensure user-centered excellence in project teams they work with.
The key job responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
Acting as the voice of the user and advocating for user-centered strategy and decision-making
Asking questions of business and developer collaborators to uncover deeper needs and goals, hidden assumptions, and new possibilities for action
Connecting user research findings (generative and testing-based) to business goals, outstanding questions, technological constraints, and more to provide useful and actionable recommendations to the product owner and project team
Determining and producing the deliverable most needed for the job at hand, such as research plans, research summaries & recommendations, storyboards and journey maps, sitemaps, user flows, wireframes, UI designs, and prototypes
Using information architecture and interaction design best practices to create user flows, screen layouts, and interactive elements that:
Fit into existing complex web & mobile products, features, and hierarchies
Are technically feasible and use existing design patterns and systems wherever possible
Collaborating with developers to get feedback at every stage, from early ideation to tweaking the frontend during buildout
Flexibly iterating throughout the design process to accommodate new information
Confidently communicating design decisions to collaborators and stakeholders

What makes this role unique or interesting?
We strive to have a supportive, fun team environment. We’re close-knit and also work with teammates in other offices around the country. We like learning from one another and sometimes do knowledge-sharing activities between developer and designer teammates. AB has a generous paid parental leave policy and other family-friendly benefits.
What is the professional development value of this role, i.e. what learning and professional growth does the role offer the candidate?
This is a generalist role that will gain more experience in every part of the UX process; for an applicant looking to deepen skills in any part of the UX spectrum, this role will provide ample opportunity.

The person in this role will also have the opportunity to contribute to Bernstein-wide UX standards, as UX here is only a few years old. Furthermore, there are opportunities for mentoring younger employees wanting to learn UX, as well as teaching UX methods to other roles in the firm. This role reports to the Service Design Lead and so there is also opportunity for visibility into and learning in the service design process as well. Our company also has regular internal cross-department learning events and will be a great fit for anyone looking to learn more about finance and investing.

You will not only have the chance to work with teammates from leading schools and design firms. Team members say they love working here because they can sink their teeth into tricky problems, have balanced lives, and continue to hone their craft in a reciprocal and encouraging environment.
You’ll be responsible for understanding the attitudes and needs of new & existing customers as well as business partners and translating this knowledge into early-stage prototypes that through iteration will ultimately become useful, usable, and breathtaking experiences delivered via desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. You’ll use your communication skills to facilitate the design process and engage in positive discussions with your design team, business partners and developers. You will make sure your team has the confidence to take risks and “fail fast.”
Our greatest inspiration will come from outside our walls; our customers hold the opportunities in their hearts, in their minds, and in their guts. They need people like you to interpret their needs from between the lines of what they say. You and your team will develop new products and improve existing ones that help people achieve their business objectives.

Strong information architecture, visual design, and interaction design skills.
Team skills: Able to collaborate in a participatory, team-based environment and support and encourage teams through collaboration as well as direction, vision, and planning of deliverables.
Communication: Strong verbal and visual presentation skills, as well as an articulate point of view about design. An ability to understand the value of design within a business context.
Prototyping: Able to learn from failure, adopt an iterative process and understand that success comes sooner with trial and error. Experience in delivering low and high-fidelity prototypes.
Bonus points for:
Ability to build appealing, pixel-perfect and production-ready visual design assets to be handed off to developers (implementing primary and secondary colors, a typographic system, incorporating iconography and photography).
Proven familiarity with HTML/CSS/JS
Proven experience and solace working within a highly-regulated industry (e.g. health care, financial services)
The Value You Deliver
Translating human-centered insights into actionable experiences for people.

And you might encounter this problem both in physical stores and online.
