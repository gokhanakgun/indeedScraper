42|PHP Developer|"At Loblaw Digital, we know that our customers expect the best from us. Whether that means building the best, most innovative online shopping experience, or designing an app that will impact the lives of people across the country, we’re up for the challenge. From our offices in Downtown Toronto, and Las Vegas , NV, we’ve created leading eCommerce experiences in the online shopping, beauty, pharmacy, and apparel spaces, and we’re only just getting started.
The impact you'll make

Our team creates the software powering the latest business offering from Loblaw Digital, an online Marketplace shopping experience. Every day we live and breathe our core value of placing the ""Customer at the Centre"". A successful day for us is one where we can go home knowing we made a positive difference in the lives of our customers and sellers, because we genuinely care about the people that use our platform. Building software is great, but building software that impacts lives is that much more rewarding.
To be part of our group is to always be looking for the best way to do something for our customers. As a new business, we diligently adhere to the Build, Measure, Learn feedback loop. We build things to see how they perform in the real world, measure that performance, and use the results to test our assumptions and hypothesis. Sometimes that may mean a great idea or piece of code has to go away, but that is a small price to pay to ensure we are building the right things and solving the needs of our users.

What You'll Do
You will be a relentless voice for our customers in delivering quality user interfaces and platforms that are both performant and accessible. Every day, you will push our team to improve our software standards and best practices, settling for nothing less than excellence. Using your exceptional experience, you will deliver high quality software and features that make our users’ lives better.

Working in agile scrum teams, you will work collaboratively with other developers, data analysts, product owners, SEOs, performance gurus, and other subject matter experts to challenge the status quo and improve the lives of our shoppers and sellers, one deployment after the other.
Your colleagues will share a lot of these responsibilities and philosophies with you. However, not everyone will be at your level and some of your colleagues may just be starting their engineering journey. Each day you will find teachable moments using your background and experience to help our engineers become their best selves.
TL;DR:
Balance code quality with business requirements and customer needs
Deliver cutting edge software that enhances our customer experience
Define SLI and SLOs and ensure we have production excellence
Collaborate with other teams to find the best solutions available, and if not, build them
Mentor and grow our junior engineers into Rockstar engineers
Does This Sound Like You?
Exceptional PHP skills (5+ years); experience with ZendFramework, Symfony, nice to have
Experience with MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch
Familiarity with Google Cloud Platform a nice to have
Advanced Front-end skills strong familiarity with modern front-end technologies is required to excel
Keen awareness and understanding of performance, security, and other software engineering best practices
The ability to pick up technology quickly. We don't say ""I'm not familiar with that technology,"" without adding, ""but let me read up on it, and I'll get back to you on it.""
Communication skills are paramount. Documenting once is not enough; being able to explain something in 5 different ways is key
You enjoy taking ownership of your work in an environment where leadership is a shared responsibility
A degree in computer science or computer engineering would help. Complex problems require complex solutions, and formal training in computer science allows us to have a common basis and language in tackling these problems.
Experience with Docker, Gitflow workflow, CI/CD pipelines, and testing strategies
Show us your past projects! We'll specifically be looking for how you decided to design your application, and of course how you decided to get it deployed and ready for customers
How you’ll succeed
At Loblaw Digital, we seek great people to continually strengthen our culture. We believe great people model our values, are authentic, build trust and make connections. We’re able to keep innovating because our colleagues are passionate about their work and excited about the future of eCommerce.
You will get to work with some of the best digital minds and will have the support of world class technologies to craft products our customers will love!

247|Digital Solutions Engineering Lead - BACK END/LARAVEL|"INTRODUCTION
Pfizer’s belief is that all people deserve to live healthy lives. This drives our desire to provide access to medicines that are safe, effective, and affordable. We advance breakthroughs that change patients’ lives and increasingly there is a digital component to the interactions we have with patients and their health care professionals.
Pfizer’s Digital Solutions and Enablement (DSE) team develop, launch and support all externally facing digital (web, mobile, omni-channel, & device) products, platforms, services, and experiences, servicing all external customer types at Pfizer.
Opportunities exist in DSE across many disciplines including web, cloud, open source, mobile hybrid, mobile native, artificial intelligence and the electronic medical record (EMR) space.
We aim to ensure that every health system stakeholder is given easy access to the information and tools they need to manage the best possible outcome for patients. We empower our stakeholders with experiences that support the detection, diagnosis, access and adherence of patients in their health journeys.
We seek qualified individuals to join us in our mission to advance breakthroughs that change patients’ lives by ensuring they have access to quality healthcare services and Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines.
ROLE SUMMARY
As a DSE Engineering Lead you will lead a development team working on digital experiences for one of our customer types: Patients and Caregivers, Healthcare Professionals, organized customers like Hospitals or Pharmacies, or internal Pfizer colleagues.
You will lead a high performing team of developers and testers, working primarily with agile methodologies, but occasionally waterfall or hybrid as warranted. You will be responsible for the technical approach, strategy and all technical outputs needed to deliver the solution/product vision and the underlying business needs.
You will work closely with the product and solution owners, client partners, architects, scrum masters, project managers, developers, testers, vendors and Platform DevOps teams to accomplish your team’s and the organization’s goals.
You will work alongside and collaborate with other platform, project and product Engineers, ensuring your technical deliverables meet all applicable DSE standards on application design, testing, quality and security.
ROLE SPECIFICS
BACK END / LARAVEL
As an Engineering Lead / Senior Developer specializing in Laravel or similar frameworks, you will consult on, lead and deliver complex PHP, AWS and service driven applications on Pfizer’s Cloud Development Platform. This stack powers many of Pfizer’s newest and most innovative custom web properties .
You will collaborate with similar roles on related technology stacks and platforms within the organisation including those working with Machine Learning, Hybrid-Mobile (Ionic), Marketo, Mulesoft, AWS, Azure, SharePoint and Native iOS/Android.
You will not only ensure your team’s technical deliverables meet all applicable DSE standards regarding application design, testing, quality and security, but also be required to deliver your own code using these technologies.
ROLE RESPONSIBILITIES
Your primary responsibilities will be providing deep technical knowledge and solid technical leadership for your team as well as hands on coding. You will be accountable for ensuring that all product and solution objectives are delivered and aligned to global strategies. This role will also be responsible for contract technical delivery resources.
This means:
You will need a good understanding of the technical landscape, both inside and outside of Pfizer. People will rely on your “hands on” subject matter expertise in our foundational technologies.
Therefore, you are responsible for the technical design, development, release management, code quality and security of the solutions/products assigned to your team. You will have autonomy within the boundaries of our standards and roadmaps to make all the technical design decisions for the products and solutions that you will be delivering.
As well as being recognized as a technical Subject Matter Expert, success in this role will require you to understand the needs of the business and be able to successfully use this knowledge in your day to day decision-making. You should be very proactive in improving your business knowledge and understanding of the internal/external best practices and marketplace so that you can spot and recommend opportunities and improvements to what we do.
The success of our organization is built upon strong relationships between our people plus constant focus on our strategies. It is critical therefore that you can establish close partnerships with your peers and colleagues in other product, solution, architecture and platform teams. You will need to collaborate widely with these peers, disseminating information and actively encourage knowledge sharing as we will all fail if we cannot ensure alignment in all areas of strategy, process, operational needs, DevOps culture, security and other areas relevant to excellence in modern software development.
As well as these technology peers, you will collaborate with Pfizer Digital leads, client partners and business stakeholders to develop ideas and deliver innovative solutions to complex business problems. As before, you will only be successful if you are able to leverage expertise and resources across multiple teams and areas.
You will use your knowledge of industry standards and your own experience to ensure that security is a key part of projects from the beginning and that your team fully embraces a DevSecOps and shift-left on security mentality.
You will be very comfortable with innovation and taking risks, agile methodologies, leveraging your development resources to implement innovative ideas/processes/ products. You will be able to guide and influence your team and stakeholders on acceptable levels of risk-taking to achieve results.
You will set the technical objectives for one or more scrum teams. In collaboration with a Team Lead, you will be responsible for skills management of the technical resources on the team and ensuring that the talent pool is appropriate for current and future needs.

264|Digital Solutions Engineering Lead - DRUPAL & BACK END PHP|"INTRODUCTION
Pfizer’s belief is that all people deserve to live healthy lives. This drives our desire to provide access to medicines that are safe, effective, and affordable. We advance breakthroughs that change patients’ lives and increasingly there is a digital component to the interactions we have with patients and their health care professionals.
Pfizer’s Digital Solutions and Enablement (DSE) team develop, launch and support all externally facing digital (web, mobile, omni-channel, & device) products, platforms, services, and experiences, servicing all external customer types at Pfizer.
Opportunities exist in DSE across many disciplines including web, cloud, open source, mobile hybrid, mobile native, artificial intelligence and the electronic medical record (EMR) space.
We aim to ensure that every health system stakeholder is given easy access to the information and tools they need to manage the best possible outcome for patients. We empower our stakeholders with experiences that support the detection, diagnosis, access and adherence of patients in their health journeys.
We seek qualified individuals to join us in our mission to advance breakthroughs that change patients’ lives by ensuring they have access to quality healthcare services and Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines.
ROLE SUMMARY
As a DSE Engineering Lead you will lead a development team working on digital experiences for one of our customer types: Patients and Caregivers, Healthcare Professionals, organized customers like Hospitals or Pharmacies, or internal Pfizer colleagues.
You will lead a high performing team of developers and testers, working primarily with agile methodologies, but occasionally waterfall or hybrid as warranted. You will be responsible for the technical approach, strategy and all technical outputs needed to deliver the solution/product vision and the underlying business needs.
You will work closely with the product and solution owners, client partners, architects, scrum masters, project managers, developers, testers, vendors and Platform DevOps teams to accomplish your team’s and the organization’s goals.
You will work alongside and collaborate with other platform, project and product Engineers, ensuring your technical deliverables meet all applicable DSE standards on application design, testing, quality and security.
ROLE SPECIFICS
DRUPAL + BACK END PHP
As an Engineering Lead / Senior Developer specializing in Drupal and Open Source, you will consult on, lead, and deliver complex Drupal, Headless and Web Component / Microservice applications primarily but not exclusively leveraging Pfizer’s Drupal platform . This platform powers all of Pfizer’s Drupal 8 web properties as well as a growing number of static sites generated via JAM stack and headless architectures. Combined with self-service content publishing capabilities, this enables us to publish hundreds of new websites a year and support thousands of updates to existing assets.
You will collaborate with similar roles on related technology stacks and platforms within the organization including those working with Laravel, Front end frameworks (Vue, Angular), Hybrid-Mobile (Ionic), Marketo, Mulesoft, AWS, Azure, SharePoint and Native iOS/Android.
You will collaborate with the Edison Platform DevOps team to influence and deliver features including automation, APIs, self-service content publishing capabilities, integrations & microservices.
You will not only ensure your team’s technical deliverables meet all applicable DSE standards regarding application design, testing, quality and security, but also be required to deliver your own code using these technologies.
ROLE RESPONSIBILITIES
Your primary responsibilities will be providing deep technical knowledge and solid technical leadership for your team as well as hands on coding. You will be accountable for ensuring that all product and solution objectives are delivered and aligned to global strategies. This role will also be responsible for contract technical delivery resources.
This means:
You will need a good understanding of the technical landscape, both inside and outside of Pfizer. People will rely on your “hands on” subject matter expertise in our foundational technologies.
Therefore, you are responsible for the technical design, development, release management, code quality and security of the solutions/products assigned to your team. You will have autonomy within the boundaries of our standards and roadmaps to make all the technical design decisions for the products and solutions that you will be delivering.
As well as being recognized as a technical Subject Matter Expert, success in this role will require you to understand the needs of the business and be able to successfully use this knowledge in your day to day decision-making. You should be very proactive in improving your business knowledge and understanding of the internal/external best practices and marketplace so that you can spot and recommend opportunities and improvements to what we do.
The success of our organization is built upon strong relationships between our people plus constant focus on our strategies. It is critical therefore that you can establish close partnerships with your peers and colleagues in other product, solution, architecture and platform teams. You will need to collaborate widely with these peers, disseminating information and actively encourage knowledge sharing as we will all fail if we cannot ensure alignment in all areas of strategy, process, operational needs, DevOps culture, security and other areas relevant to excellence in modern software development.
As well as these technology peers, you will collaborate with Pfizer Digital leads, client partners and business stakeholders to develop ideas and deliver innovative solutions to complex business problems. As before, you will only be successful if you are able to leverage expertise and resources across multiple teams and areas.
You will use your knowledge of industry standards and your own experience to ensure that security is a key part of projects from the beginning and that your team fully embraces a DevSecOps and shift-left on security mentality.
You will be very comfortable with innovation and taking risks, agile methodologies, leveraging your development resources to implement innovative ideas/processes/ products. You will be able to guide and influence your team and stakeholders on acceptable levels of risk-taking to achieve results.
You will set the technical objectives for one or more scrum teams. In collaboration with a Team Lead, you will be responsible for skills management of the technical resources on the team and ensuring that the talent pool is appropriate for current and future needs.
You will have the experience to be able to drive cost savings through effective estimation, vendor selection and negotiation.

The challenges of this role…
Like any dev role, balancing timelines, budgets, requirements, and customer happiness is always a challenge. Because this is a senior level role, we generally expect you to be able to get up to speed quickly and be self-sufficient for the most part. You’ll be working in a team of 3-6 other developers under a Technical Manager that helps your team deliver its work. At any given time, you may be working on several projects at the same day, so jumping back and forth between projects is always a challenge in an agency environment, but we try hard to let developers focus more time on fewer projects when we can, as we understand that’s how we become more efficient as a group.
What it’s like to be a remote developer at Taoti
Many companies hire remote developers and treat them like code monkeys that they pay to deliver code. Taoti is different. Taoti wants to hire you as part of our in-house team. And while you may not technically be under our office roof, you’re as much a part of the team as those who are. We’ll sing happy birthday to you over video chat, fly you to DC for company retreats, and communicate (usually via Slack) all day long with you. Better yet, you get many of the benefits that we offer the rest of our employees, like paid time off and holidays (and if you’re in the United States, health insurance, retirement account contributions, etc.) You’ll get a fixed monthly salary, regardless of how many hours you work, even if we have nothing for you to do (but that won’t be an issue—we always have work to do.) You may be technically be a subcontractor to us, but we’ll treat you like an in-house employee. And we want you to treat us the same way! (Note: Taoti has about 50 employees. About 20 of them are developers. And of those 20, more than half are spread throughout South, Central, and North America. Most of the non-developer staff is based out of our DC office, so we have a unique culture in that regard, but it works well.
Tips for getting onto the short list…
First, you have to be a senior level developer and have the experience and code to show us that you really know what you’re doing. There will be several interviews and code reviews. It’s important that you’re a good cultural fit in addition to being an excellent coder. We want to know that you will work well with in a team both technically and socially. It isn't just about the code for us. Your personality and contribution to our culture are important to us as well. Finally, because we value communication and collaboration so highly, great English is a must. It's the reason we are only considering the Americas and not India or Europe. There are great devs there too, but we want people who are awake when we are and can work with us in real time.
What’s the corporate culture like?
We have a great culture (in fact, we've won several awards for being so cool! ;-) We're a pretty casual shop. You can generally wear whatever you want. Lots of telework flexibility. You’ll have access to anyone/everyone in the company, including the CEO. Not only is it okay to question decisions and policy, but it’s part of your job to do so when you see a better way. The team is fun and social. We do a lot in and outside of the office together—from boat trips to happy hours to roof yoga. There are all sorts of perks and benefits, but culture isn’t about perks and benefits—it’s about a way of thinking. And our way of thinking goes back to the mission: to move the needle. We’re all about doing great work that gets meaningful and measurable results for our clients. And everything else that we do here, be it fun or work, in some way drives towards that objective. (As one employee puts it, “We’re fun, but focused.” That sums it up pretty well. There are some pictures of the office on the website and our Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/taoticreative/?hl=en. Always feel free to drop in and see for yourself.
What about benefits?
(Note: the below are benefits for in-house, W2 employees. If you are remote, you generally get most of these benefits, but there are a few differences for logistic and legal reasons.)
3 weeks PTO for starters. You gain more with tenure. And if you’re really big in to PTO, you can even trade back some salary for more.
Telework options (which work like PTO… you accrue days with each paycheck. TELE days increase with tenure as well. By your fourth year, we don’t even count them any more.)
100% company-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance. (50% for qualifying dependents.) And we have good insurance.
Paid family leave for men and women (including PTO plus short and long term disability options.)
3% retirement plan matching (plus access to a financial advisor).
Home buyer help (including a $1200 closing credit)
Mobile phone reimbursement
You can opt for a company-supplied PC or Mac laptop. Or if you want to use your own, we’ll reimburse you for it.
Charitable contribution matching
Guaranteed annual raises
Tax-free metro benefits
A legit 40-hour work week (not 60 hours like some shops essentially require)
Weekly, in-office Yoga and Meditation sessions
Money and time off allocated for professional development (also increases with tenure)
A diverse team hailing from over 15 countries last time we checked
A very hip/cool/funky/quirky office space on Barracks Row, in the heart of Capitol Hill. Just 2 blocks from the metro! (With the office space doubling in size next year as we build a new building in the parking lot next door to our building.)
Fun perks like a roof deck, wine/beer always on tap, regular company boat outings (boat is walking distance from the office), chill work environment, etc.
No real dress code (within reason, as long as you can be an adult about getting dressed for work)
Weekly yoga and meditation classes
Annual global retreat (where we bring the whole team together for fun, games, and teamwork)
Of course, the above is a quick list. See the handbook for all the gory details.

Next steps…
If you’re qualified and interested, please apply on our website (www.taoti.com/careers.) Please note that these job ads often get placed onto other websites with their own application systems (we’re looking at you Jooble!) We aren't able to respond to applications that don’t come through our own website (Because we use software to manage our hiring process, and without it, it would be the wild west here. So please be sure you’re applying on our website.)
Equal Opportunity Employer
Taoti embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.
Pretty please, no recruiters."

While we appreciate the passion and dedication that go into those vocations, we've found that throwing stars and lightning-fast arpeggios are not the skills we need to turn out great digital work.
The Job
At Elevated Third, we build everything from fully responsive marketing sites to complex web applications, all on top of Drupal. We're looking for a mid-level Drupal developer with solid experience in PHP frameworks and/or CMS's.

About You
You believe in the power of an open, collaborative environment and value the opportunity to work in a space where you can ask questions and provide answers between heads-down code sprints. Your passion for learning new skills and technologies is always apparent in your clearly documented, clean code. You love writing code, but never forget the interests of the end user and overall site performance. You're excited to work closely with everyone in the company and can clearly communicate complex technical problems in a way that is useful for non-developers. You want to be a part of building products that deliver meaningful results and refreshing user experiences.
Responsibilities
Work collaboratively with the design and account teams to build client sites and applications.
Clearly communicate technical challenges to those with less technical knowledge in service of a great end product.
Build, test and deploy feature additions for existing Drupal sites with a strong eye for detail, test performance and cross-browser compliance.

Experience with Drupal and another PHP framework/CMS.
Mastery of web fundamentals, like HTML/CSS, strong knowledge of Javascript.
Strong working knowledge of PHP and MySQL.
Experience with command line tools and applications.
Strong working knowledge of Git.

Fresh perspectives are always appreciated, but as an existing, functional website, with time and budget demands, the team would require a quick learner, excellent listener, and clear communicator who can adjust their practices where necessary.
Experience should include a strong working knowledge in: WordPress custom development, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SASS, GitHub, with optional but highly valued experience in the Genesis framework, WooCommerce, web accessibility standards, and an interest in education-focused projects. An understanding of the Genesis framework will be invaluable, as this is the platform for our agency website. The developer should have reliable testing practices, a professional level of understanding around web standards and browser quirks, and demonstrated experience working on a team with other developers. The developer must be able to produce well-structured and semantic markup for the other developers for styling and further front-end work.
The freelance role is entirely remote, though required to be in the United States, and with a preference for the Pacific time zone. Please submit examples of projects (websites or GitHub) with a rough outline of your role and responsibilities. We're hopeful to establish an ongoing relationship which could result in a few hours a week to possibly more over time.

We aren’t ‘fast-paced’ like Wall Street but we do work smart in finding solutions to our clients problems, quickly.
We didn’t invent a new software language that is considered ‘cutting edge technology’ but we did create our own kick-ass development framework on top of CakePHP (and who doesn’t like cake?) that we build everything on.
We are growing and we’ll take our time to find the RIGHT developer.
Our ‘team-spirit’ can sometimes be cheesy but hey, we like each other and if we hire you, we like you too so you’ll get used to it.
We really are ‘fun’. We have catered lunches, happy hours, kitchen snacks and fun company excursions because, well again, we like each other and like to have fun! You might even get your desk pranked while you’re on vacation or get your very own character drawn on the chalkboard walls.
We code mostly in CakePHP, using MVC patterns and MySQL. However, what we are primarily concerned with is that you have a strong working knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (and be honest, because our team is good and can tell from talking to you). If you're solid there, then we can teach you the rest.
Make sure that you can jQuery the Bootstrap out of the Version Control when you are ready to apply, since you'll need those skills too.
We have flexible work hours and rarely ever work overtime - work/life balance is extremely important to us.
Our developers are ‘self-motivated’ and ‘self-directed’ but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have processes it just means that you will have ownership and accountability for what you do.
Our developers are smart and curious; they want to learn and grow. If that describes you, you'll fit right in!
Required:
B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent work experience
6+ Years Internet development industry experience
Expert OOP (PHP preferred)
Advanced MVC (CakePHP preferred)
Advanced SQL (MySQL preferred, should be able to work as DBA)
Version Control (SVN or Git)
Excellent Knowledge in HTML/CSS/JS
Bootstrap
jQuery or similar JS framework

The NSM Development Team
As part of the development team, you will have the opportunity to work with experienced developers striving to create great experiences for our clients. We are active in local meetups and encourage all team members to continue learning and sharing their knowledge internally, as well as in the community. Our work connects us directly with project managers, designers, and sales teams to make sure that projects are staying in scope and on target with deadlines. We are always open to new ideas and strive to make the team better whenever possible.
What should you expect when applying for a job at North Star Marketing?
The first step is to make sure that you have completely filled out the form on our website at https://www.northstarmarketing.com/jobs. That will get the process started.
We start off with a quick (15 to 20 minute) phone interview. This is mainly to get to know each other and make sure that we are on the same page for what the job entails and that you are willing and capable of doing the work. There are a few very high-level development questions that will be asked but that is just to give us an idea of your current development knowledge.
The second step is for us to give you a small (shouldn't take more than 5 hours to complete) project in order for us to see your code and how you work. This may be an optional step depending on the availability of coding samples. We normally allow two weeks for this to be completed but if you need more time, just ask. Communication is a big deal. There is the possibility that there will be another project depending on the number of applications and if there is something, in particular, we are looking for that might not have been communicated well. This will be on an as-needed basis and also should not take any longer than 5 hours to complete.
The third phase of the interview process is a Dev Team interview. This is where you get to meet the team you would be working with and we can talk about your project as well as any other questions you might have or our team might have for you.
The fourth part of our hiring process is a North Star Team interview. For this, we will bring you into the office to meet face-to-face with the leadership team and a good portion of the North Star team.
The entire process normally takes about 4-weeks but it depends on the total number of applicants and scheduling. Our goal is to clearly communicate with you during this process. If you have any questions you can always shoot us an email and we will be happy to answer.

We are a small team of fast-moving. self-managed nerds that only require one thing, results. I'm looking for someone that is ready to put in the time and effort to create something great. How many times have you seen mediocre sites..blech!? If we're going to put our time and effort into something you should be able to show all of your friends after work what a kick-ass developer you are. Do you think the people that make shitty websites show off their work?
We want to create sites that inspire and motivate people, and ultimately get them to make a purchase. Ever share a site's design on Facebook with your friends? Or checked out the underlying code of a webpage to see what template they were using? Do you have a file of screenshots on your phone where you keep sites that are AMAZING?
The Nerds On Call family of companies, Home Technology Pros, Home Technology Handyman, and Squirrel Digital Marketing are looking for a Front End Web Developer for Wordpress sites. You'll be providing services for our companies and clients.

if you've read this far I forgot a couple of things. This isn't work from home, you'll have to put real clothes on to come to an office. I'm not looking to outsource so if you are looking for clients and not employment, you'll only waste your time by applying.
