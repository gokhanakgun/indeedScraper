Prepare detailed strategy and performance reports for clients on a monthly basis
Analyze keywords and SEO techniques used by competitors on an ongoing basis
Develop and implement on-site SEO strategies
Identify powerful keywords and topics to drive the most valuable traffic
Fill websites and other content with effective keywords
Write and/or edit effective SEO content for blogs & websites
On-site HTML code optimization

We believe that through trial and error, the best ideas are born. This is why we promote Fearless Failure, allowing each team member to eliminate apprehension and go all in on presenting a new idea, even if it doesn’t end up successful.
We believe in radical transparency, a way of communication that puts everything on the table. Everyone has the opportunity and responsibility to provide feedback and speak freely, no matter who presented the idea. This practice is easy when the news is good. It’s when friction and disagreements occur that transparency becomes more difficult, more necessary and far more impactful.

Our environment is built on the fundamentals of safety and trust, not comfort. Comfort leads to complacency, and complacency leads to dull ideas. Through safety and trust, we allow each team member to present ideas with the knowledge that he or she will be heard.

With award-winning facilities and spaces, technology, equipment, and services, EXOS connects people to the solutions they need and provides individualized plans based on time-tested fundamentals and research in order to help people take control of their health and performance. To learn more, visit www.teamexos.com.

While making-the-world-a-better-place is often taken lightly these days, we’re actually trying to live up to its original intent by helping people get stronger, recover faster, feel less pain, and get healthier. In order to do this, we need to see the world through the eyes of our members and design compelling communications to help them achieve their goals. That’s why we need your help.
Responsibilities:
We are looking for a Marketing Director to articulate, craft, and implement marketing plans for our member services and future product portfolios. You will guide a cross-functional team of business owners, account leads, operators, and designers among others focused on driving consumer engagement across all digital and physical channels. You will direct the execution of marketing programs designed to reach, drive traffic, and convert on a local, regional, national, and (eventually) global scale.

This role is also integral to the continued growth of the EXOS brand and will be responsible for partnering with our brand marketing, content, and lead generation experts to deliver on our promise of helping people move well so they can continue to do the things they love to do (or didn’t know they could do).

DAY-TO-DAY RESPONSIBILITIES

Be a champion for the consumer by partnering with strategic planners and researchers to uncover quantitative and qualitative insights that influence business, product, brand, and marketing strategies.
Leverage these insights to lead the development and implementation of omnichannel marketing programs that drive consumer awareness, adoption, and activation. This includes marketing plans (e.g., integrated advertising campaigns, promotions, on-site activations, etc.) that are grounded in key business initiatives, drive revenue growth, and maximize customer value.
Use the appropriate consumer-facing marketing channels including traditional media (e.g., direct mail, print, radio, OOH, PR, etc.) and digital media (e.g., email, social, OLA, paid search, etc.) with a focus on CAC, conversion rates, engagement metrics, and LTV.
Build, implement, and execute CRM and marketing automation strategies for higher touch, personalized communications focused on conversion and retention.
Define marketing program success metrics and then monitor, analyze, and measure effectiveness to optimize strategies in real time — investing further in tactics that move the needle while scaling back on tactics that don’t produce results.
Develop a modern consumer marketing tech stack that allows us to leverage data insights to inform decisions that drive business goals.
Collaborate and build relationships with key stakeholders across our Extended Leadership Team, Business Development, Sales, Operations, Performance Training, Product, Brand, Content, Creative, Production, and Program Management to effectively bring integrated marketing plans to life in the field.
Partner with Marketing Operations to evolve internal marketing processes that in turn improve the quality, timeliness, and efficacy of deliverables.
Other duties as assigned.
Qualifications:
Required Qualifications:

You graduated with a BA in marketing, communications, or a related field that helped you become a successful consumer marketer. A postgraduate degree (e.g., MBA) in a related area is strongly preferred but not required.
You have a minimum of 8 years of experience in consumer marketing for consumer-facing brands.
You have a minimum of 4 years of experience guiding diverse, cross-functional teams.
We want to hear about your failures as much as your successes, so we’re asking all candidates to share any relevant artifacts (e.g., marketing plan frameworks, case studies, slide decks, etc.) as part of the initial vetting process to give us a better sense of your growth and development as a marketer.

Our Ideal Candidate Profile:

You have numerous wins (as well as losses) in your career when it comes to consumer-facing, omnichannel marketing campaigns across paid, owned, and earned media.
You use insights, analytics, and various tools from your tool belt to generate strategies that break through the clutter.
You have been successful with small marketing budgets that you’ve grown over time by investing in the right strategies and tactics.
You are seen as a consumer marketer today but have experience with B2B2C and B2B brands from your past life.
You are an excellent presenter who can adapt your message to a variety of audiences.
You ideally have a mix of consumer brand and agency experience.
Your appetite for reading is insatiable – especially when it comes to business & cultural trends.
You are a student of advertising and traditional marketing concepts but also know when to adapt vs. doing things by the book.
You are able to travel as needed to collaborate with local teams and ensure the EXOS brand promise is delivered in-market. The exact percentage of travel required will vary based on the marketing plans you develop.
Other (obvious) qualities:
You love collaborating with others to solve problems.
