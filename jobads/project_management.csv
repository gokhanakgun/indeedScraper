Our core purpose is simple: every day we strive to provide unmatched customer and employee experiences and foster a culture of respect, diversity, and transparency. It’s this culture, our people, and delivery that come together to make Centric a trusted advisor to local businesses.

Our Louisville business unit is passionate about making a positive impact in the community. We strive to live our Centric core values and embed them in the work we do for our clients and in our corporate citizenship role. We’re looking for a Project Manager to join our growing team.

In this role, you will:

Work closely with the client to translate project requirements into achievable deadlines, and ensure schedules and budgets stay on track using standard management methodology.
Lead project team members, and provide ongoing feedback, supporting them in their efforts to meet project goals and create unmatched client experiences.
Partner with our clients to identify and resolve issues, in a timely and transparent manner.
Ensure project deliverables meet our Delivery Excellence expectations.

Impact – We think of ourselves as a big company with a small company feel – a local player with global reach that combines business, technology and industry expertise.
Unmatched Experiences – We are allowed to be ourselves here. We are encouraged to be human. It’s at the root of who we are as a firm and why we’re here .

Fourth is the first global cloud-based intelligent back office platform in the restaurant and hospitality. We’re no ordinary software company! We pride ourselves on the culture we have created and work hard to ensure this is never compromised. This is a place where our people want to work; where they enjoy and develop in their roles; where our people pull together to work as a team and ultimately be a company we are all proud to be a part of.

By developing innovative products, building relationships with our customers and enabling great careers; we are focused on building lifetime loyalty with our customers and each other. The vast majority of us have worked within the industry; we believe we need to be passionate about and have experienced the industry in order to help our customers grow their businesses successfully.

When recruiting, we look for those who want to join our journey; those who want to be a part of our personality and culture; those who are professional; have energy, enthusiasm, and ambition, are entrepreneurial and those who can show they can live by our company values each day. Working at Fourth + HotSchedules provides an opportunity to build a successful career where our people develop and grow in a dynamic, fast paced environment.

The Role
Fourth has grown internationally at a substantial pace. Presently we are in the midst of global expansion presently entering the US market. As a business that has never lost a customer it is critical our delivery capabilities continue to match existing success.

Fourth’s focus lies in efficiency – upgrading and unifying our technical stack, ensuring products are always available, increasing automation and modernising delivery mechanisms via mobile and tablet apps for continual efficiency. Our Agile transformation, driven by Carly Hodges (Director, Lean-Agile Centre of Practice & Improvement, LACPI) , has been critical to this.

Carly and Frikkx have been working closely to drive more organisational agile and promote Lean to ensure the business is as streamlined as possible. The last transformation has been moving more toward SAFE. This initiative is currently in full motion, with Carly serving as Director of Practice, Steve Lewins as RTE, currently driving one of our Agile Release Train and Becky Nixon as the Senior Scrum Master.
We already employ a number of Scrum Masters across our London and Sofia-based Engineering teams, but as we continue scaling we are now hiring for an additional Scrum Master (London based) to manage two of the Scrum teams across both locations. You will be required to work with these teams to further improve their output and assist us in our journey of attaining a proactive, well-tuned workforce.

Presently, our Scrum teams are broken down according to our 3 core platforms, each further broken into capabilities that represent a particular feature or codebase. Across Workforce Management (WFM) we have two core Scrum teams, Labour and Payroll with scrum teams reciprocated across both London and Sofia and upon joining you will be aligned to a given scrum team/ capability.

As Scrum Master, you will be tasked with the continual improvement of these teams, coaching them in principles and methodologies – such as Lean, Scrum, Kanban and in the fullness of time SAFe which we are currently driving throughout the organisation. This will enable delivery of products of the highest quality.

You will be responsible for the ongoing evolution of the Scrum processes, facilitating all Agile ceremonies including sprint planning sessions, sprint reviews (system demos), retrospectives, team backlog refinement, and daily stand-ups within the Fourth Agile Framework – as well as the metrics attached to these.

Alongside these responsibilities, you will support Frikkx with the launch/ ongoing coordination of an Agile Release Train (ART) across your specific business area. This will involve taking ownership of related documentation such as retrospective formats or story point estimations.
Ultimately, your aim will be to work alongside our Product managers, Product Owners, other Scrum Masters, and team members to ensure Agile methods are embedded and refined to enable maximum efficiency and the delivery of excellent output wherever possible.
Our Story
In July 2019 Fourth joined forces with HotSchedules to become the global leader in end-to-end restaurant and hospitality management technology solutions. Together, the merged company now represents the world’s largest and only provider of end-to-end restaurant and hospitality management solutions for customers across the globe and of all sizes—from a single location or franchisee restaurant to a global restaurant or hotel chain.

About Sitetracker
Sitetracker was founded seven years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the #2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people-first culture."
