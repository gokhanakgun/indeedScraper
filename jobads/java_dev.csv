Location: Tysons Corner, Virginia
Employment Type: Full-time
Citizenship: US Citizenship

What do we do?:

We do work for the government, we build modern web apps that look good and work well. Our product has a front end built on TypeScript / JavaScript, React / Redux, and SASS. The back-end is a REST API built on Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. We have custom integrations with some really neat applications such as Rocket Chat, ArcGIS, Tableau and others.

What's the job?:

We are looking for a developer who is passionate about writing good code. Someone who understands the importance of doing things the right way, rather than cutting corners. Someone who believes that writing code is a way of life, not simply a means to an end. The perfect candidate will be able to embrace these ideals while still pumping out code at a good pace.

Who are we?:

Why would you want to work for Tesla? (Not the car company, the other one.) It's a really good place to work. We make important software that people actually use. There are people here you can learn from. You will write new code, not just maintain old, buggy code. We work hard, but we don't work to death. We understand inspiration doesn't work on a time table. We're a small company, so we can do things the right way.

We give our people 4% matching on 401k contributions, health insurance and pay decent salaries. We'll set you up with a MacBook Pro and two monitors so you can spread out. If you don't have a car, no big deal; we're close to Metro and bike trails, but if you do have a car, we have free parking (and EV chargers). We also have showers if you ride your bike (and a gym to go with those showers).

Your daily tasks will vary between front-end and back-end work, so you should be comfortable and happy doing both.

Who are you?:

Do you enjoy solving complex problems? Do you dream in code? Do you want to make great software that informs important decisions around the globe? If so, we'd like to meet you.

Now, on to the requirements. We are open to candidates with varying levels (at least 1 year) of experience in front-end and/or back-end development. You should have strong working knowledge in the following areas, frameworks, and tools ...
Front-end
TypeScript / JavaScript, ES6 / ESNext
Promises, async/await
HTML, CSS / SASS
React / Redux or similar front-end frameworks
RESTful web services
Git, NPM, Node
Jest for unit tests

Back-end
Java 8 / 11, lambdas, streams
Gradle / Maven
Spring Boot, Hibernate (HQL)
MySQL
JUnit
Extra points for: Linux, MongoDB, Docker, RPM, Jenkins

We give our people 4% matching on 401k contributions, health insurance and pay decent salaries. We'll set you up with a MacBook Pro and two monitors so you can spread out.

We also have showers if you ride your bike (and a gym to go with those showers).

Where :do I sign up?:

Sound good? If you're up for it, prepare a cover letter including a brief (one paragraph) description of a development project you have worked on, your role, and the outcome. If you can, include a link to one of your projects on GitHub, or somewhere else on the ‘net.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
