Why Cisco
WE ARE CISCO
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Are you a problem solver, explorer, and knowledge seeker – always asking, “What if?”
If so, you may be the new team member we’re looking for. Because at SAS, your curiosity matters – whether you’re developing algorithms, creating customer experiences, or answering critical questions. Curiosity is our code, and the opportunities here are endless.
What we do
We’re the leader in analytics. Through our software and services, we inspire customers around the world to transform data into intelligence. Our curiosity fuels innovation, pushing boundaries, challenging the status quo and changing the way we live.
We are looking for a strong analytical tester to join our Natural Language Processing (NLP) R&D team here at SAS. Not sure if you are a strong analytical tester? Very few of us started out as one. While testing knowledge is nice to have, the right candidate is someone with the right mind and skill set that may not know they are an analytical tester yet.

The NLP R&D team’s mission is to equip customers with the tools they need to analyze unstructured data. These tools are powered by innovative algorithms that solve problems such as categorizing documents, information extraction, identifying topics, predicting sentiment, searching a document collection, or predicting the words spoken in audio files.

How do you know if you have the right mind and skill set to be an analytical tester? If you regularly check Kaggle competitions, Stack Overflow, or have subscribed to the machine learning subreddit, this is a good start. If you are kind and respectful while holding your ground, you may be a good fit. If you see the opportunity in every challenge and enjoy solving problems, even better. If you have ever questioned a result from Python’s scikit-learn library and were compelled to reprogram the modeling technique with NumPy to check the result, submit your resume. If you then reported suggestions for improvement, welcome to the chosen.

If you’re the right fit, you will join a team that takes pride in building a world-class development culture. The team is passionate about understanding our customers and meeting their expectations. We have an insatiable curiosity and we desire continuous improvement. This improvement applies to our algorithms, the technologies we use, the processes we use, and most of all, ourselves.

What you’ll do
As an Analytics Software Tester and a member of the Natural language Processing team in the R&D Advanced Analytics Division at SAS, you will help us achieve our goals in a variety of ways.
You will:
Consult product management to understand what kinds of problems our customers have and validate that our unique algorithms solve these problems.
Stay current with analytical methodologies, software testing best practices, and cutting-edge technology.
Develop code to verify that the results are correct. This may include independently coding the algorithm or cross-validating results against SAS or third-party products.
Construct scenarios to intentionally try to break the code. This will involve thinking like a customer, a mathematician, an architect, and a developer.
Write, execute, and automate test scenarios that can be run through an automated test framework.
Adhere to best practices in developing and maintaining large volume of testware.
Collaborate closely with our team of developers and linguists by reporting problems that are found and providing suggestions on how we can improve.
Assist Technical Support and consultants in resolving customer issues.
Uphold agile principles by participating in team planning meetings, acceptance meetings, and scrums.
What we’re looking for
You’re curious, passionate, authentic, and accountable. These are our values and influence everything we do.
You have a master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.
2+ years of experience programming in Python, SAS, C/C++, Java, or R.
2+ years of experience with artificial intelligence, machine learning, or data mining.

The nice to haves
Experience working with text or audio data.
Experience with natural language processing (NLP).
Experience with building text analytics, text mining, automatic speech recognition, or deep learning models.
Base and Advanced SAS Certification.
Experience testing software.
Git, Gerrit, and Jenkins.
Docker and Kubernetes.
Agile software development methodologies.
PhD in Statistics, Computer Science, or a related quantitative field.

Other knowledge, skills, and abilities
Well-organized with a strong ability to prioritize, plan, and execute tasks.
Solution-oriented with strong ability to solve complex problems.
Great conflict resolution skills and high emotional intelligence.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills.

Test game for defects and document detailed bug reports
Create and implement product test strategy for each release
Regress bug reports to verify fixes and close issues
Primary ownership, administration and communication of all QA related project data and associated risks for all assigned projects
Collaborates on and maintains all project related internal QA test plans to verify proper function, data content, performance, usability/playability, and hardware/software compatibility
