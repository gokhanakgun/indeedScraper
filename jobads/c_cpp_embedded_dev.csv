Our clients span a range of industries from consumer electronics to medical devices, automotive, and robotics. Mindtribe recently joined Accenture to lead connected hardware development as part of a new group called Industry X.0.

We’re looking for a midlevel embedded software engineer to join our team. We code most often in C but will use whatever it takes to get the job done. Our midlevel engineers can plan out their work and drive it to completion. They’ve also seen a good swath of the product development lifecycle, including prototyping, working on production code, and some exposure to mass production.
Why should you join us?
My name is Mike, and I’ve been on our team for over 10 years. As a product development consultancy, we get to peek inside a lot of exciting companies. That’s how I know there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.
Nobody sees the kind of variety that we do. Working here is being immersed in a constant stream of projects across different industries using different technologies. You will learn. A lot. About everything. Our engineers are not just versatile within their own fields firmware engineers work with everything from 8bit micros to embedded Linux to smartphones we also have EEs driving SolidWorks, MEs developing iOS apps, and FW engineers laying out PCBs. You’ll iterate through many careersworth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. And you’ll get better at it each time.
Everyone here loves hardware, so much that we’ve been known to spend leisure time on projects that aren’t so different from what we do at work. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. We may code in bits and bytes, but we work in the real world. Our desks are cluttered with dev boards and prototypes. We work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates, discuss our work throughout each day, and build amazing things together. Were constantly in front of clients to extract feedback, plot course corrections, and lead the way.
Day-to-day, we work in closeknit teams of typically 2 to 6 engineers. Here are the types of things our firmware team get excited about.
Programming on 3 different microcontrollers and getting them all to talk together. Wirelessly.
Figuring out the magic init sequence to harness an OLED display that you harvested from a smartphone.
Convincing embedded Linux to boot on a board that a coworker designed from scratch.
Getting an LED to blink juuuust right.
Sleeping soundly because you’re just as proud of your test suite as you are of the code its bulletproofing.
We still operate like a small company within Accenture. As a result, your contributions will have immediate, visible impacts not just on projects, but also on the success of the organization. Although we all swab the decks, everyone also gets to help steer.
We are located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, convenient to public transit and at an epicenter of a flourishing technology industry. Our team enjoys working together, and we greatly value maintaining an awesome company environment. We look for people who are bright, enthusiastic, and fun We regularly spend time together outside the office, whether that’s doing happy hour at a local watering hole or enjoying the rocking chairs at the Exploratorium. If this is resonating, we’d love to get to know you.

About the Unit
We are a startup incubated at the TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health at the University of Chicago, and supported by Schmidt Futures. We’re a rapidly growing team creating technical solutions for pressing challenges in early childhood development. We’re looking for talented individuals who enjoy building and delivering high-quality products. If you’re excited to develop technology for social good, come join us! We’re seeking a highly motivated, hands-on signal processing engineer. You will lead the design and implementation of algorithms on-the-cloud capable of accurately detecting and categorizing adult and child speech. This is a full-time position, but contractor relationships may be considered. We’re based in NYC and Chicago, and remote-friendly. Project Background: Our team’s mission is to give all children an equal opportunity to reach their fullest cognitive potential. Research shows that the most critical window for a child’s brain and language development is from birth to age 3. The most important predictor of a child’s educational success is the quality and quantity of adult-child interactions during these earliest years. Parents need tools that guide them through this formative time period. Our goal is to develop scalable, easy-to-use wearable devices that measure conversational interactions and empower parents. Our product is like a ‘Fitbit’ for early childhood language development - it attaches to a child’s clothing and gathers information about the number of words children are exposed to. It’s connected to a smartphone app that provides feedback to parents and other caregivers on progress and how to improve. The Team: You’ll be joining a talented and enthusiastic team of computer scientists, early childhood development researchers, and experts in security, privacy, and design. We’re supported by the Schmidt Futures network, a community of distinguished figures in technology, including Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google and Executive Chairman of Alphabet. The visionary behind this project is Dana Suskind, MD, a pediatric surgeon turned social scientist and author of the 2015 book ‘Thirty Million Words: Building a Child’s Brain’. She co-directs the TMW Center, where she is advancing a novel public health approach that empowers parents to influence their children’s language and cognitive development. Dana’s work has been profiled by numerous media outlets, including the New York Times, The Economist, Forbes, NPR and Freakonomics among others. Our technical advisory team includes: Pedro Lopes is a technical advisor for wearable device development. He is an Assistant Professor at UChicago, where he leads a research group focused on human computer interaction and wearable computing. Nick Feamster is Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Center for Data and Computing at UChicago, and an advisor on security and privacy for IoT devices. Marshini Chetty is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UChicago. Her focus is advising on human computer interaction, IoT devices, and building technology for empowerment. Ben Zhao is a technical advisor and Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at UChicago. His current research covers a range of topics including adversarial machine learning, data-driven models of user behavior, and privacy-preserving mobile and wireless systems. Heather Zheng: Heather is the Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago. Heather is a technical advisor on mobile computing and networking. John List: John is a UChicago economist and Chief Economic Advisor at Lyft, known for pioneering field experiments to test economic theory and to provide guidance to policymakers and business leaders. We are looking for an engineer who can lead algorithm development to upgrade the existing device to capture ‘conversational turns’ between parents and children.

654|EMBEDDED SOFTWARE ENGINEER / APPLICATION ARCHITECT|"COMPANY VISION
The world has seen tremendous growth in products that combine data from embedded sensors to perform intelligent functions. This functionality has enabled us to interface more naturally with our devices and has also improved our lives by alerting us to dangers or maintenance needs (e.g. biosensors, alarms, equipment condition monitoring). While enhancing the user-experience, these always-sensing products are also a major contributor to ""big data"" as they improve the way we exercise, communicate, secure our homes, monitor our health, and maintain our equipment. One of the big challenges device manufacturers face is to meet the market demand for untethered always-sensing products by porting this always-sensing functionality from corded products to battery-operated products without sacrificing sensing capabilities and maintaining reasonable battery-life and keeping data to a manageable level.
Aspinity's unique analog processor marks a paradigm shift in the way data is collected. Just as the brain makes sense of its multi-modal sensory input by focusing higher-order cognition on salient characteristics, Aspinity enables developers to extract ""sense"" from sensors before the data is even digitized, which reduces power consumption and allows the system to focus compute resources on relevant information. With already established applications to voice control, sound classification, machinery monitoring, and distributed power grid monitoring, Aspinity's programmable analog processing technology is positioned to be the key abstraction layer for the physical world at a time when new user interface paradigms (touch to voice to …) and new monitoring capabilities are transforming industries.
