The CISO understands that securing information assets and associated technology, applications, systems and processes in the wider ecosystem in which the organization operates is as important as protecting information within the organization's perimeter. A key element of the CISO's role is working with executive management to determine acceptable levels of risk for the organization.

The CISO must be knowledgeable about both internal and external business environments, and ensure that information systems are maintained in a fully functional and secure mode and are compliant with legal, regulatory and contractual obligations.

While the CISO is the leader of the information security program, he or she must also be able to coordinate disparate drivers, constraints and personalities, while maintaining objectivity and a strong understanding that cybersecurity is foundational for the organization to deliver on its business goals and objectives. Ultimately, the CISO is a business leader, and should have a track record of competency in the field of information security and/or risk management, with seven to 10 years of relevant experience, including five years in a significant leadership role.

Summary of Duties:
Overall: The Zone Facility Information Security Official (FISO) is responsible for leading, driving and, in some cases, implementing Information Security (IS) activities and measures in company facilities supported by the division, under the supervision of the Division Director of Information Security Operations (DISO).
Facilities: These include hospitals, company-managed physician offices, Consolidated Service Centers (CSCs), Ambulatory Surgery Division (ASD) centers and certain other facilities in the division. Depending on the IT model and complexity of the division, the Zone FISO may be assigned to lead and drive IS activities in a few facilities or possibly all facilities in a market or division.
IS Activities: These activities are part of the enterprise (company-wide) and division-specific IS programs and operations. IS activities at the facility-level are primarily based on: (a) ongoing IS work and expectations outlined in the company’s IS policies, standards, and guidance documents, (b) new and/or prioritized IS work in the Facility IS Action Plans from the Corporate IS Department, and (c) IS aspects in projects from the IS Department, IT&S Department, Business Units and Division.
Enterprise IS Program: The enterprise (company-wide) IS program is led by the VP & CISO and IS Department in IT&S. Together with the DISO, the Zone FISO is the “face” of the enterprise and division IS programs to facility leadership, workforce members, and other people and entities (e.g., physicians and certain vendors) affiliated with the facility. The Zone FISO is responsible for implementing the company’s organizational IS agenda, championing improvements to reduce IS risks to patients and business operations in the facility, and serving as a bridge between the division and the facility.
Division IS Program: The division IS program is led by the DISO. The division program includes implementation plans and activities for the enterprise IS Program and projects, and division-specific IS plans, activities and projects. Like the enterprise IS Program, the Zone FISO is responsible for leading, driving and ensuring the division IS program is implemented in the Zone FISO’s assigned facilities.
Facility IS Program: Generally, the facility IS program and facility IS activities are based on implementation and ongoing, operational compliance with company IS requirements. These activities include both Information Technology (IT) and non-IT related areas. In addition, all facility workforce members have a role regarding IS. The Zone FISO is responsible for leading, driving and helping the facility and facility workforce members appropriately comply with the company’s IS requirements.
Approach: The Zone FISO drives the results the company wants by extending the reach of the enterprise IS program into facilities. This includes developing IS processes, building staff awareness and competencies for security, and effectively collaborating across boundaries to ensure enterprise IS goals and company priorities are met and business value is realized.
Relationships: This role requires extensive focus on building and expanding relationships with key stakeholders such as Facility leadership, Facility workforce members, Physicians, Division leadership, Division IT team, other Zone FISOs, IS department, business partners and vendors, and other people and entities who support the IS objectives and activities at the facility.
Other: The Zone FISO must have and will use a combination of skills including IT technical skills, IS knowledge, people relating skills, written and verbal communication skills, interpersonal skills and the ability to develop, communicate and follow processes to get technical and non-technical work accomplished.

Ensure issues in IS reports are addressed (e.g., SAPortal reports, Passport reports, SecurID activity reports, Internal Audit Self-Monitoring Report).

In conjunction with the division IT team, ensure corporate-mandated service packs, patches and hotfixes are applied to facility servers and workstations within the defined time periods.

Provide facility-level reporting to the DISO to identify and act on facility-specific IS issues.
IS Risk Management

Lead risk management processes and decision-making involving each facility, within the framework established in the enterprise IS program.

Ensure the designated facility committee (e.g., Facility Security Committee, Facility Ethics & Compliance Committee) receives, documents, tracks, investigates and acts on suspected IS breaches and complaints.

Perform walkthrough of the facility to identify potential or actual IS issues on at least a quarterly basis (e.g., physical security of MDF/IDFs; active sessions on unattended workstations; posted passwords).

Work with facility personnel and the DISO to complete, submit, and track Security Exception Request Forms (SERFs).

Team with facility and division personnel to remediate system issues that are noted in approved SERFs.
IS Vendor Systems Security

Coordinate IS activities with vendors at the facility.

Ensure proper vendor contracts are in place for division and facility IT systems and services.

Ensure division and facility-specific IT systems and services receive proper assessments before implementation.

Ensure implementation of specified IS architectures for enterprise vendors (e.g., anti-virus, logging, auditing, authentication, authorization, configuration management, encryption and remote access management/monitoring).

Ensure vendor systems use approved connectivity, remote management and monitoring.
IS Communication

Facilitate, and lead where appropriate, IS communication and awareness in the facility.

Coordinate with the facility HR and training departments to ensure that periodic workforce training includes company-required IS content (e.g., protection from malicious software; procedures for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting discrepancies; procedures for creating, changing, and safeguarding passwords; procedures for reporting security incidents).
